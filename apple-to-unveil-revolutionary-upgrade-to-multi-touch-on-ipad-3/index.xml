      <description>&lt;p&gt;#&amp;ldquo;Apple to unveil revolutionary upgrade to multi-touch on iPad 3&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to many complaints from users of the iPad 2 that the 8finger-2thumb gesture to switch between Apps was too simplistic, we can exclusively reveal that Apple will shortly announce their &lt;strong&gt;Multi-Toe Interface&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent research has shown that 82% of iPad usage is on the sofa in front of the TV. Apple further discovered that over 73% of people watch TV with their shoes off. New CEO Tim Cook joined the dots and Multi-Toe was born.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter&#34; title=&#34;Multi-Toe&#34; src=&#34;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-y3S0PtE5D7E/TxAz-Cm1uLI/AAAAAAAATkI/fNzYOw_YfTA/s640/IMAG0173.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;361&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you can simulate the Android Back button by simply applying both hands and feet to the iPad simultaneously. Milton Bradley has already announced support in their upcoming iTwister game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rumours are also swirling that the follow-up iPad 4 will come with Bum-Touch where ass-dialling becomes a feature, not a bug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
