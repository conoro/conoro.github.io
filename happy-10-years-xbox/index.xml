      <description>&lt;p&gt;#&amp;ldquo;Happy 10 Years XBOX&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;posterous_bookmarklet_entry&#34;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;posterous_medium_quote&#34;&gt;XBOX users also have access to arguably the best media center application on any platform. XBMC started because the XBOX needed a good media player, but it evolved into something so much larger. Streaming media files from the network with library organization, weather support, XBOX game trainers, a game/program launcher, and an entire build of python to run a plethora of scripts which can be created by anyone. XBMC has been unsurpassed by many other media applications, some of which you must pay for.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;posterous_quote_citation&#34;&gt;via &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.xbmc4xbox.org/happy-10-years-xbox&#34;&gt;xbmc4xbox.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always love it when CE devices last way beyond their intended obsolescence date. We still have two XBOXes which are used daily as XBMC media players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both bought secondhand, both hacked, both utterly brilliant. The most recent version of XBOX4XBMC was only released a while back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll keep using them until the majority of video becomes MP4, which unfortunately they usually don&amp;rsquo;t have enough welly to play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
