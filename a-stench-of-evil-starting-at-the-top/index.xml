      <description>&lt;p&gt;#&amp;ldquo;A stench of evil, starting at the top&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;posterous_bookmarklet_entry&#34;&gt;
 &lt;blockquote class=&#34;posterous_long_quote&#34;&gt;In May of that year, Ratzinger issued a confidential letter to every bishop. In it, he reminded them of the extreme gravity of a certain crime. &lt;em&gt;But that crime was the reporting of the rape and torture.&lt;/em&gt; The accusations, intoned Ratzinger, were only treatable within the church&amp;rsquo;s own exclusive jurisdiction. Any sharing of the evidence with legal authorities or the press was utterly forbidden. Charges were to be investigated &amp;ldquo;in the most secretive way &amp;hellip; restrained by a perpetual silence &amp;hellip; and everyone &amp;hellip; is to observe the strictest secret which is commonly regarded as a secret of the Holy Office &lt;em&gt;under the penalty of excommunication&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;rdquo; (My italics). Nobody has yet been excommunicated for the rape and torture of children, but exposing the offense could get you into serious trouble.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;You wonder why snakes like Brady behave like they do? Just look to the boss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
