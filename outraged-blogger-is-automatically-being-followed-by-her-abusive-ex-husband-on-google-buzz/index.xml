 &lt;p&gt;I am now convinced no-one outside of Google ever tested this product before they went for global launch.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am also convinced that no-one inside Google had the balls to tell the people who built it that it was riddled with problems and was about as ready for release as Duke Nukem Forever.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen a webapp released with so many fundamental glaring flaws in all my life by a global company. This could easily be Google&#39;s own Bob.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
