      <description>&lt;p&gt;#&amp;ldquo;My Smartphone evolution from N95-8GB to Samsung Galaxy S4 #SGS4&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/smartphones.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-large wp-image-1010&#34; alt=&#34;smartphones&#34; src=&#34;https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/smartphones-1024x469.jpg&#34; width=&#34;584&#34; height=&#34;267&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first actual &amp;ldquo;Smartphone&amp;rdquo; was a Nokia N70 but it has the dubious pleasure of being the only phone I ever lost. The one that really got me using Apps and understanding the importance of SoLoMo was the classic N95-8GB which I loved despite its numerous flaws. It was also the most I ever spent on a phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I realised that Android would be an unstoppable juggernaut, I got a HTC G1 back in Nov 2008, shortly after it was released. Still a fine phone and I do love that slidey keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I followed that with the HTC Desire which was many people&amp;rsquo;s first Android phone and still afirmfavourite with lots of them. Our 13 yo has had it for the past 2 years and the only thing he dislikes even now is the lack of storage to install Apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought an Orange San Francisco (ZTE Blade) for my Dad as a test intro to Android. He took to it no problem and now has a Nexus S. Our 11 yo has had the Blade for the past year. A shockingly solid piece of kit for something that cost 99 without contract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Aug 2011 I was chuffed to learn I had won a HTC Sensation from Vodafone. That&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;ve been using until today. It was and is a superb piece of hardware let down by pretty awful software from HTC and some really ropey build quality. It is alsounfortunatelynot that popular with the creators of custom ROMs and I&amp;rsquo;ve never had a ROM which works 100% reliably with all the features. Bluetooth is a particular pain in the ass. But the Cyanogenmod ROMs still beat anything HTC themselves released.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then we get to 2013. It&amp;rsquo;s currently a three horse race for most people between the HTC One, the Sony Experia Z and the Samsung Galaxy S4. On paper based on raw specs, the S4 wins. The other two are better looking phones and apparently are better built. I don&amp;rsquo;t trust Sony in general with maintaining products and they always overprice, so the Z is out. Loyalty should have me buying the HTC One but three drawbacks have forced me into the arms of Samsung for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first, and worst, is that you cannot ever replace the battery in the One. This isn&amp;rsquo;t like the iPhone where it&amp;rsquo;s awkward and requires tools. You have to physically destroy the HTC One to get at the battery. In a world where people are starting to return to the idea of repairability in products and owning things for longer, this is a disastrous decision by HTC. I have had spare batteries in my pocket for my phones since N95-8GB days, I can&amp;rsquo;t go back to worrying about my phone running out of charge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add to that the lack of an SD Card slot and a weirdly de-specced 4MP camera and I&amp;rsquo;mafraidHTC will be sold for spare change to someone like Microsoft before the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So SGS4 it is. Hands-on in the shop was a very impressive experience. But I haven&amp;rsquo;t even turned it on at home yet. More when I do.&lt;/p&gt;
