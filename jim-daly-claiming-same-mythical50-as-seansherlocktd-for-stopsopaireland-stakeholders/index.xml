      <description>&lt;p&gt;#&amp;ldquo;Jim Daly claiming same #mythical50 as @seansherlockTD for #stopSOPAIreland Stakeholders&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I emailed the three TDs in Cork South West (2 FG, 1 Lab) two days ago about #stopSOPAIreland. Noel Harrington&amp;rsquo;s office (FG) replied within a few hours by email in a pretty generic but still positive way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This morning I got a letter in the post(!) from Jim Daly (FG) with a very detailedresponsegiving the official line as expressed by Sen Sherlock. Kudos to whoever in his office wrote the letter, it had all of the pertinent information. Sidenote: If they replied by email the country would be less broke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the letter (see below), consultations were had with these mythical fifty stakeholders that Sen Sherlock keeps referring to, last June/July.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is the Minister of State able to identify even one &amp;ldquo;stakeholder&amp;rdquo; who represented the interests of webhosts like Blacknight, web infrastructure providers like Amazon, major Social Media companies like Facebook, Search/Video companies like Google/YouTube, online Gaming companies like PopCap, Enterprise Ireland, the IDA or the average internet user? We have already confirmed that he never talked to the Irish Internet Association.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll still waiting on theMinister&amp;rsquo;sLabour colleague in Cork South West to reply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/JimDalySOPALetter1.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone size-large wp-image-533&#34; title=&#34;JimDalySOPALetter&#34; src=&#34;https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/JimDalySOPALetter1-744x1024.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;584&#34; height=&#34;803&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: Several people on Twitter have pointed out that I&amp;rsquo;m not reading this correctly. There were 50 submissions but we have no idea how many Stakeholders. It could be 2. Much more disturbing is Steve White&amp;rsquo;s comment below. His post highlights that the submissions were not specific to the Statutory Instrument at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
