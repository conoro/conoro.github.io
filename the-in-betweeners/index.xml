      <description>&lt;p&gt;#&amp;ldquo;The in-betweeners&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like many people, my blogging activities have collapsed. A lot of that is due to work commitment but another large part of it is that I post most quick thoughts and ideas to Twitter or Facebbok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem there is discoverability and conversation threads. Sure someone can find a tweet weeks later but they&amp;rsquo;ll never be able to reply to it in an intelligible way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I still don&amp;rsquo;t have time to do full blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So think of this as the iPad of my online presence. It&amp;rsquo;s for stuff that is too long for Twitter/Facebook (and deserves longevity) but is too short for all my Wordpress blogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like my first blogpost in 2001, this may be the last thing I write here for months :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
