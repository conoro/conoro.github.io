                        <p>#&ldquo;My first stab at silicone mould making to cast an RC car suspension part&rdquo;</p>

<p>Regular readers will know that I&rsquo;m a huge fan of the <a href="http://conoroneill.net/makey-makey-raspberry-pi-iracer-bluetooth-cheese-controlled-car-ccc/">Dagu Arexx i-racer RC car</a>. It&rsquo;s cheap, light, fast, uses Bluetooth, has a removable shell and is perfect for n00b families like us who have never really done the RC thing properly.</p>

<p><img class="alignnone" alt="" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/iracer-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></p>

<p>Unfortunately after some over-exhuberant use recently, we broke a part of the suspension on one of the front wheels. Over the space of a few weeks I tried everything to fix it without success. That included:
<ol>
    <li>Trying to hand-mould thermo-plastic onto the remaining suspension member to rebuild the broken bit. It refused to stick</li>
    <li>Supergluing pieces of metalonto the remaining suspension member. They fell off.</li>
    <li>Soldering metal and wire onto the wheel hub to completely replace theremaining suspension member. This worked but was so loose and bendy that the car just drove around in circles.</li>
</ol>
<a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2013-06-07-20.47.48.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1103" alt="2013-06-07 20.47.48" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2013-06-07-20.47.48-1024x576.jpg" width="584" height="328" /></a></p>

<p>In the back of my mind I started justifying the cost of a 3D printer even tho I knew they were unsuitable for things that small.</p>

<p>I had pretty much given up when I read <a href="http://hackaday.com/2012/10/17/moulding-new-gears-for-a-micro-helicopter/">a post on Hack A Day</a> about a guy creating new gears for his RC helicopter using silicone moulds and polyurethane resin.</p>

<p>The last time I tried to mould something was when I was about 12 and my sister got one of those castle-making kits where you had to make each &ldquo;tile&rdquo; from plastercast in green moulds first and then glue them together. Infuriating thing. What was that called? Can&rsquo;t figure it out from Google.</p>

<p>But this guy&rsquo;s approach looked perfect and appeared to make a strong item.</p>

<p>So I ordered some <a href="http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Mouldcraft-GP-RTV-325-Shore-A25-255g-Silicone-Mould-Making-Rubber-Kit-/261082208350?ssPageName=ADME:L:OC:IE:3160">GP-325 RTV Silicone Mould Making Rubber</a> and <a href="http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/MOULDCRAFT-A2000L-120gm-Fast-Cast-Polyurethane-Liquid-Plastic-Casting-Resin-kit-/251095395566?ssPageName=ADME:L:OC:IE:3160">A2000L Easycast Polyurethane resin</a> from a UK seller on eBay recently and it arrived last week.</p>

<p>I really wasn&rsquo;t sure how to approach it so I just got stuck in. I removed the matching suspension part from the other wheel and put it in a plastic cup.I then mixed the two parts of the silicone as instructed and poured it over. Due to a rubbish kitchen electronic scales I wasn&rsquo;t sure if the mix was correct so I let it dry for 24 hrs.</p>

<p>I popped the dry rubber out of the cup and could see the outline of the piece. I gently cut in with a blade and was shocked when the piece came out with no aggro and left behind a really impressive impression. The fact that the central hole was moulded perfectly too was the big surprise.</p>

<p>Phase two was less straightforward. I mixed the polyurethane and poured it into the mould. Despite tapping and squeezing etc, what came out an hour later was pretty stunted. I obviously had big issues with air pockets. So I cut away a bit at the top of the mould to make it easier for air to get out and the mixture to get in.</p>

<p>The second one was better but still not right. More rubber cutting ensued.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1104" alt="2013-06-08 18.00.11" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2013-06-08-18.00.11-1024x576.jpg" width="584" height="328" /></p>

<p>The third mix was all wrong and never set.</p>

<p>Fourth time&rsquo;s a charm and I got a &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; copy of the original. Obviously with lots of extra bits which I had to cut away.</p>

<p><a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/moulds.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1106" alt="moulds" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/moulds-1024x576.jpg" width="584" height="328" /></a></p>

<p>I gave it about 16 hrs to cure, just in case.</p>

<p><a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2013-06-08-01.00.05.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1107" alt="2013-06-08 01.00.05" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2013-06-08-01.00.05-1024x576.jpg" width="584" height="328" /></a></p>

<p>A tiny amount of trimming and it fit perfectly.</p>

<p><a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/wheels.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1108" alt="wheels" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/wheels-1024x576.jpg" width="584" height="328" /></a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m genuinely stunned. I didn&rsquo;t really expect a great result here but I got exactly what I needed. This method is amazing and so bloody easy.</p>

<p><a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2013-06-08-12.38.25.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1109" alt="2013-06-08 12.38.25" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2013-06-08-12.38.25-1024x576.jpg" width="584" height="328" /></a></p>

<p>On the downside, I am concerned about the strength of the cast. Particularly the vertical bit which is what broke in the original too. I&rsquo;m tempted to do another cast where I run a thin wire in the correct place to add some robustness. Having the mould means I can make as many of these as I like.</p>

<p>Is there any retail outlet in Cork/Dublin that sells the materials to do this kind of moulding? It&rsquo;d be great to talk to someone who has done lots of it before about improving strength and flexibility and playing with the mix ratios.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll update this when I&rsquo;ve had a chance to test the car out properly.</p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;What does this inside of a dead Fitbit One look like? This:&rdquo;</p>

<p>After my <a href="https://www.blocbuy.com/87/product">Fitbit One</a> took a swim in a full washing machine cycle, it died. Many attempts with rice and pampers and warm air over a few days failed to bring it back. The utterly fantastic customer support people in Fitbit then offered me a free replacement! The only tiny downside is that they don&rsquo;t deliver to Ireland so I needed to use a <a href="http://www.parcelmotel.com/">Parcel Motel</a> address. It just arrived yesterday so I thought I may as well have a look inside the dead one.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s bloody well glued together so it took a while. I could instantly see that there was no hope that it would have recovered. Horrible green corrosion on many places on the motherboard.</p>

<p><a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2013-06-07-17.08.52.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1100" alt="2013-06-07 17.08.52" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2013-06-07-17.08.52-1024x576.jpg" width="584" height="328" /></a></p>

<p>The main CPU/MCU is a ST Microelectonics ARM M3 (<a href="http://www.st.com/web/catalog/mmc/FM141/SC1544/SS1374/LN1041/PF251638">STM32L151QCH6</a>) running at 32 MHz with 256KB flash. Same one as the Nike Fuelband, interestingly enough. I figure its built-in USB interface is a real selling point.</p>

<p>The LiPo battery is the smallest I&rsquo;ve ever seen and I hope I can salvage it. Also the tiny buzzer motor might be usable somewhere.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1099" alt="2013-06-07 17.08.41" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2013-06-07-17.08.41-1024x576.jpg" width="584" height="328" /></p>

<p>The Nordic Semiconductor <a href="http://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/Products/Bluetooth-R-low-energy/nRF8001">nRF8001 IC</a> is very interesting. It&rsquo;s a full-blown single-chip Bluetooth 4.0 BLE (Low Energy) solution. I&rsquo;ve been looking around for hobbyist BLE chips/dev-boards recently but they are too expensive. I&rsquo;d love to see BLE used in home automation setups.</p>

<p>Our experience with tracking down a lost Fitbit inside the house using BLE sync from my phone to my wife&rsquo;s Fitbit has made me a big fan of the technology! It would never ever have been found without being able to send alarms and triangulating in on where the lost device was. I eventually found it behind the lining inside a travel case in the airing cupboard after it had fallen from my wife&rsquo;s armband in the middle of the night as she grabbed new bedclothes for one of the children. The last time something went missing in the airing cupboard, we lost a Nintendo DS for a year.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d love to see the next Fitbit have all the functionality of the One but also be 100% waterproof. Maybe simple capacitive touch instead of a button? That and the fact that the sleep timer has zero intelligence around auto-turn-off are the only criticisms I can make of an otherwise brilliant device. The recent update allows it to sync directly with my SGS4 so travelling will no longer be a &ldquo;dark period&rdquo; for up-to-date tracking.</p>

<p>Do yourself a favour, buy one and shock yourself when you realise just how inactive you really are.</p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;Is the \u008010 Lidl Soldering Iron worth it? I think so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I grabbed one of the Lidl Soldering Iron Kits yesterday in Dungarvan. Video below with my thoughts. Apologies for some of the stuff being off camera.</p>

<p>httpv://youtu.be/UrQyGAgDACo</p>

<p>Overall, at 10 it is totally worth a punt if you don&rsquo;t have an iron already.</p>

<p>Regarding the non-standard tips, it turns out there are compatible replacements out there. <a href="http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/0-5mm-Pointed-Soldering-Iron-Spare-Tip-Fits-Duratool-D00803-Variable-Temperature-/360559527019">This seller on eBay</a> has some. Also, <a href="http://ie.farnell.com/duratool/d00803-b8-1/spare-tip-d00803/dp/2081159">Farnell do them</a> for 1.15 each, but with the usual proviso that it&rsquo;s a minimum 20 order with them, so you&rsquo;ll need to find some other stuff to buy on the site. Shouldn&rsquo;t be hard :-)</p>

<p>Maybe next time around, Lidl could go with standard tips, dump the &ldquo;burning tips&rdquo; and include some parts to do a simple project.</p>

<p>As I mentioned in the video, a huge part of my DIY and electronics gear comes from Lidl and Aldi. I think there is a real opportunity for one/both of them to do a lot more in the Maker area. An Arduino Start Kit for maybe 19.99 would fly out the door once word-of-mouth got started. I predict a 3D Printer &ldquo;Thursday Special Offer&rdquo; sometime around 2016.</p>

<p>Rather than struggle with the very basic unprotected IO pins on the Raspberry Pi and the lack of real-time performance in Linux, the ideal setup for many real-world-interfacing projects is Raspberry Pi + Arduino.</p>

<p>After pricing a multitude of combinations of microcontroller boards and Wifi adapters, I found that the Raspberry Pi + USB Wifi + Arduino is the absolute best value for money if you need both wireless internet access and easy sensor data handling. (Note: I&rsquo;ll be investigating the <a href="http://beagleboard.org/Products/BeagleBone%20Black">Beaglebone Black</a> soon to see how it compares).</p>

<p><a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2013-06-05-07.32.44.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1088" alt="2013-06-05 07.32.44" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2013-06-05-07.32.44-1024x576.jpg" width="584" height="328" /></a></p>

<p>There are four basic ways to connect Arduino to Raspberry Pi:
<ol>
    <li><span style="line-height: 15px;">Buy an add-on board like the Gertboard which has an Arduino compatible IC on it. Pricey.</span></li>
    <li>Plug a standard Arduino like an Uno or Nano into the USB port of the RPi. This is by far the easiest method and minimises wiring and hassle. However it requires the more expensive Arduinos.</li>
    <li>Use a <a href="http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=250893154137&amp;ssPageName=ADME:L:OU:IE:3160">USB to Serial adapter</a> with a cheaper/smaller Arduino like a Pro Mini or a self-made <a href="http://shrimping.it/blog/">Shrimp</a>. This is the best DIY option and has the same advantage of method 2 that you can power the Arduino/Shrimp from USB. For a Model B RPi, I&rsquo;d recommend this route.</li>
    <li>Use the Serial Pins on the Raspberry Pi to connect to a cheaper/smaller Aruduino like a Pro Mini or a self-made Shrimp. This is theoretically the cheapest method but by far the most hassle. This is also the best method if you are using the cheaper Raspberry Pi Model A and its single USB port is being used for Wifi.</li>
</ol>
I won&rsquo;t go into the details of 1 since I haven&rsquo;t done it. 2 and 3 are plug n play and require no instructions. 4 is the awkward one, so here are some notes to save you the hassle I went through.</p>

<p>The basic steps are identical to those described <a href="http://blog.oscarliang.net/raspberry-pi-and-arduino-connected-serial-gpio/">here</a>. In hardware terms You connect the 3.3V/GND/TX/RX pins on the Raspberry Pi via <a href="http://dx.com/p/jy-mcu-5v-3v-iic-uart-spi-level-4-way-converter-module-adapter-178286?Utm_rid=73941134&Utm_source=affiliate">a level converter</a> to 5V/GND/RX/TX pins on an Arduino. Alternatively you buy a 3.3V Arduino and avoid the need for a level converter. I powered the Arduino separately to avoid overloading the RPi pins (this seems to be causing intermittent issues with RPi booting tho).</p>

<p>RPi software changes involve commenting out this line in /etc/inittab with a #
<pre><code class="language-bash">T0:23:respawn:/sbin/getty -L ttyAMA0 115200 vt100</code></pre>
and removing the following parts of the one line in /boot/cmdline.txt
<pre><code class="language-bash">console=ttyAMA0,115200 kgdboc=ttyAMA0,115200</code></pre>
You also need to create a link to the serial port so that the Arduino IDE recognises it:
<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo ln -s /dev/ttyAMA0 /dev/ttyUSB9</code></pre>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">That last step has to be done after every reboot</span>. I should find a way to make it permanent.</p>

<p>Unfortunately this still isn&rsquo;t enough to be able to program the Arduino from the IDE running on the RPi. We need to be able to toggle the reset pin on the Arduino to initiate programming. Normally that&rsquo;s done by the USB-Serial adapters or the USB-Serial chip on the more expensive Arduinos. To do this in our setup requires <a href="http://www.deanmao.com/2012/08/12/fixing-the-dtr-pin/">following the instructions here</a>where one of the Arduino tools is wrapped in a script which does the pin toggling at exactly the right moment. In summary:
<ol>
    <li><span style="line-height: 15px;">Connect Pin 11 (GPIO 17) of the RPi to the DTR Pin on the Arduino Pro Mini via the level converter</span></li>
    <li>Run the following commands to download and configure <a href="https://github.com/deanmao/avrdude-rpi">avrdude-rpi</a>:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-bash">
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python-dev
sudo apt-get install python-rpi.gpio
wget <a href="https://raw.github.com/deanmao/avrdude-rpi/master/autoreset">https://raw.github.com/deanmao/avrdude-rpi/master/autoreset</a>
wget <a href="https://raw.github.com/deanmao/avrdude-rpi/master/avrdude-autoreset">https://raw.github.com/deanmao/avrdude-rpi/master/avrdude-autoreset</a>
sudo cp autoreset /usr/bin
sudo cp avrdude-autoreset /usr/bin
sudo mv /usr/bin/avrdude /usr/bin/avrdude-original
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/avrdude-autoreset /usr/bin/avrdude
sudo chmod 755 /usr/bin/avrdude-autoreset
sudo chmod 755 /usr/bin/autoreset
</code></pre></p>

<p>I was getting a warning about &ldquo;Channel already in use&rdquo; from /usr/bin/autoreset so I added this to the end of the file:
<pre><code class="language-bash">PIO.cleanup()</code></pre>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Note you must run the Arduino IDE as root from now on</span>. i.e. in LXTerminal:
<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo arduino</code></pre>
If you haven&rsquo;t already, reboot the RPi to make the earlier steps kick in. You should now be able to program whatever you like on to the Arduino using the IDE running on the Raspberry Pi. I even have this running headless by connecting to the RPi across the network using the Windows Remote Desktop Connection tool.</p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;Replacing a broken Samsung Google Nexus S screen - a total doddle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My Dad put a big crack is his Nexus S screen a good while back so I promptly ordered a replacement <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/Replacement-LCD-Touch-Screen-Display-Assembly-For-Samsung-Google-Nexus-S-i9023-/290768756299?">from eBay</a>. I finally got the chance to fit it this morning and was thrilled that I didn&rsquo;t manage to completely screw it up.</p>

<p><a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2013-06-01-12.38.10.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1085" alt="2013-06-01 12.38.10" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2013-06-01-12.38.10-1024x576.jpg" width="584" height="328" /></a></p>

<p>A few useful notes:
<ol>
    <li><span style="line-height: 15px;">There are two major types of Nexus S. His is an i9023</span></li>
    <li>Apparently there are also two different types of i9023 screen which are not interchangeable. Luckily the one I ordered just worked.</li>
    <li>It&rsquo;s really easy to take the phone apart
<ol>
    <li>Pop the back off</li>
    <li>Remove a few screws</li>
    <li>Remove the inside back, popping off the snap-connectors as you go</li>
    <li>Be careful popping out the buzzer</li>
</ol>
</li>
    <li>You remove the screen+digitizer module by applying lots of heat with a hairdryer. Use a plastic knife or plastic phone tool to apply leverage from the side and work your way around. Eventually it&rsquo;ll separate.</li>
</ol>
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UBkjwNJbS8">This video</a> shows how to do it for the other Nexus S model but the steps seem almost identical.</p>

<p>The only bit that had me worried was the adhesive. It was pretty much ruined by taking the screen off. I went to the local DIY store an bought a selection of double sided tapes and contact adhesives.</p>

<p>I the end I used some ALDI thin-ish double-sized foam tape to connect the top and bottom parts where the earpiece and buttons are. I then used simple Unibond no-thickness double-sided tape to cover the back of the screen. Together they joined the screen to the main body of the phone perfectly.</p>

<p>Then it was just a quick reverse process of clicking back on the connectors and putting screws in. It worked perfectly first time. And I had no parts left over!</p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;Wearable tech, fitness, health and the \&ldquo;Quantified Self\&ldquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nice quick intro by iJustine into this entire <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/">Quantified Self</a> area. The section about using all of the data for predictive prevention of problems really caught my attention.</p>

<p>httpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjKA0-PSA9k</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve obviously been into the whole SoLoMo thing since first getting my hands on an N95-8GB in 2007 and I&rsquo;ve been generating lots and lots of location data since then. But location is really only step zero. It gets far more interesting the more things you measure, which is why I also tried my first fitness tracking app on the N95 back then too.</p>

<p>Now I spend my day with a Fitbit One connected to my t-shirt; manually entering my weight, body/visceral fat, BMI, muscle from Omron Karadascan to Google Docs; having every run/walk tracked by RunKeeper or Endomondo; and, from this week, having an array of sensors on my desk measuring temperature, humidity and light. The latter set will soon be stored live to the web. My SGS4 has a barometric pressure sensor too and will be the &ldquo;base-station&rdquo; for all my experiments in this area.</p>

<p>One bit I&rsquo;m missing is heart monitoring. I have an ancient chest-strap monitor from Lidl but it has no computer interface and is very uncomfortable. iJustine showed off an Adidas smart-bra which seems to have the functionality I need. Perfect for my moobs. Now I just need to find the male equivalent (or buy one and modify it :-) ). Alternatively I could try making one with some conductive cloth and an Arduino or will I end up in DSP filter hell? A <a href="http://pulsesensor.com/">fingertip sensor like this</a> might be fine for some scenarios but you&rsquo;re hardly going to wear it 24x7. Any other suggestions?</p>

<p>The only way you can improve is by measuring. I think we&rsquo;re in for a very interesting couple of years and I can&rsquo;t wait to see what people come up with.</p>

<p>UPDATE 1: According to comments on the <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11574">Sparkfun site</a>, that Pulse Sensor can be used on many parts of the body, including the chest. As I haven&rsquo;t found any other Open Hardware projects that do heart rate monitoring, I think I&rsquo;ll take a punt on it for $25.</p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;Check out Scratch for Arduino (S4A). Easier electronics for kids&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whilst I&rsquo;m a huge fan of the Arduinoinitiative(is &ldquo;initiative&rdquo;the right word?), its programming language, Wiring, is still fundamentally C with most of its power but also most of its difficulty.</p>

<p>C was the fifth language I learned after ZX Spectrum BASIC, Forth, Z80 assembler and Fortran (spit). I then spent the next 13 years using little else. But here I am still struggling to read a number from a sensor, add it to an ascii string, send it over a wireless link and then convert that back to a number at the far end. The wireless link bit is trivial using <a href="http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/">VirtualWire</a>, whilst the pain is all in the int/char/char */char []/String rubbish that would make most kids give up after an hour of hair pulling. And don&rsquo;t get me started on Null termination.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m very positive about both <a href="http://www.modk.it/">Modkit</a> and <a href="http://seaside.citilab.eu/scratch">S4A</a>. Modkit is a pay-for in-browser Scratch-like environment and I&rsquo;m impressed with it, but I&rsquo;ll blog about that another day. Today is about S4A which came out of a <a href="http://citilab.eu/en/citilab/what-is">Citilab team</a> in Spain. It&rsquo;s a modified version of Scratch that can interact with Arduino boards and electronics connected to it. I tested using an Arduino UNO and it worked perfectly.</p>

<p><a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/s4a.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1057" alt="s4a" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/s4a-1024x635.jpg" width="584" height="362" /></a></p>

<p>Getting started is very easy. You <a href="http://seaside.citilab.eu/S4AFirmware15.ino">download some code</a> for the Arduino which you put on the board using the usual <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software">Arduino IDE</a>. Then you <a href="http://seaside.citilab.eu/S4A15.exe">install S4A</a>on your PC and run it.</p>

<p>There are <a href="http://seaside.citilab.eu/s4a_basic_examples.zip">some basic examples</a>available to learn the core ideas.The examples all come with simple wiring diagrams which are appropriate for anyone with one of the UNO Starter Kits.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;ll be interesting to see what we can do beyond simple button+led. I&rsquo;m trying out some of the servo stuff with Oisn this afternoon.</p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;Remote Control implementation for an RC Car - Part 1&rdquo;</p>

<p>There are many ways you can add remote control to a project. Off the shelf modules; Bluetooth; 2.4GHz NRF24L01+ transceivers; 433MHz/434Mhz modules or even Infra-red.</p>

<p><a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/remote_control.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1059" alt="remote_control" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/remote_control-1024x576.jpg" width="584" height="328" /></a></p>

<p>My plan with <a href="http://conoroneill.net/progress-so-far-with-a-kids-e21-self-assemble-remote-control-car/">our ZL-4 el-cheapo RC</a> car was to use an <a href="http://www.elecfreaks.com/1999.html">Elecfreaks Joystick Shield</a>, an Arduino board and the<a href="http://www.ebay.ie/itm/1X-NRF24L01-2-4GHz-Antenna-Wireless-Transceiver-Module-For-Microcontroller-WST-/271133536748?ssPageName=ADME:L:OC:IE:3160#ht_5792wt_1385">NRF24L01+</a> modules mainly because [a] the joystick shield has a connector for one and [b] I want to use them in another potentiallycommercialproject and thought it would be a good learning exercise. They are also stunningly cheap at 1.26,includingshipping, for each transceiver.</p>

<p>Unfortunately Idiscovered that the Adafruit Motor Shield on the RC car uses up a ton of the pins on the Arduino and makes it very hard to add theNRF24L01+. In particular it uses the SPI pins which you need to talk to theNRF24L01+.</p>

<p>So I went with Plan B which was the 433Mhz modules. These things are fab. They work in the unregulated ISM band like most weather stations etc and, like the NRF24L01+,are gob-smackingly cheap - 1.97 for <a href="http://dx.com/p/diy-433mhz-wireless-receiving-module-for-arduino-green-149252?Utm_rid=73941134&Utm_source=affiliate">the receiver</a> and 2.14 for <a href="http://dx.com/p/433mhz-wireless-transmitter-module-superregeneration-for-arduino-green-149254?Utm_rid=73941134&Utm_source=affiliate">the transmitter</a>. When I see people creating really simple projects but with 2x 20+ Zigbee modules, I just don&rsquo;t understand it.</p>

<p>The 433MHz modules main advantage relative to theNRF24L01+ is that they can cover longer distances with a properly setup aerial. The main disadvantages are that they generally need that aerial, they have a very low bit-rate and you have to deal with most of the error correction etc yourself.</p>

<p>What transforms these modules into something pretty spectacular is the <a href="http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/">VirtualWire</a> library for Arduino. This takes care of all the low-level transmit/receive code and you have to do little more than the equivalent of a print statement. Just think about this. You can send any information you like over hundreds of feet using 4 worth of electronics by simply calling:
<pre><code class="language-bash">vw_send((uint8_t *)msg, strlen(msg));</code></pre>
No Wifi or SMS needed! Of course this is a broadcast message and anyone can pick it up but who cares.</p>

<p>The one thing we do have to figure out is what happens when multiple devices are broadcasting locally. Will they interfere with each other? I know VirtualWire has CRC checking but that&rsquo;s not much use if every message is corrupt.</p>

<p>For the remote control I have created an extremely simplistic &ldquo;protocol&rdquo;. The transmitter sends out the following every 200ms:
