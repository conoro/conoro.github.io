                        <p>#&ldquo;Right, I need recommendations for dirt-cheap diesel Land Rover type thingy&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yesterday I read rumours of early winter snow in Ireland. We&#39;ve had a couple of winters of either &quot;surprising&quot; snow or horrible floods in Bandon. It&#39;s time to embrace my inner mucker and buy a proper farmer-style SUV. I&#39;m not talking silly frou-frou soccer-mom pretend-off-roaders, I want something that can go up a vertical cliff in low gear and do 4000 mpg on diesel.<br /> <p /><div>The preferred specs are as follows:</div><div><ol><li>Less than 5k</li><li>Mileageirrelevant</li><li>Diesel</li><li>Full-time proper 4WD</li><li>Possibly low-ratios selectable</li><li>Maybe lockablediffs</li> <li>Possibly 7 seats</li><li>Can go through Irish floods without noticing them</li><li>Can drive on snow without noticing it</li><li>Can also do the Cork-Dublin return run in one day without me going deaf or losing my fillings/sanity</li> <li>Can do 120kph <em>cough</em> comfortably</li><li>Utterly reliable (my 10 y/o 120,000 mile Mondeo has never once let me down)</li><li>Must have 8-track player with Demis Roussos carts :-)</li></ol><div>Whilst I&#39;ve long hankered after one of those black Land Rover Defenders with the exhaust going out the roof, my guess is that they fail on 10, 11 and 12?</div> </div><p /><div>So oh Twitter/Facebook/Posterous gurus, what do you recommend? Some big old Japanese yoke? I&#39;ve heard you can get 2003 Range Rovers for 13k so I assume I can get something lower down the food chain for the target 5k or less. Also any recommendations for where to buy?PreferablyMunster.</div> <p /><div>Oh and what&#39;s the story with insurance/tax on some big diesel behemoth? Did the Greens make it difficult? What mpg do these things do anyway? I can do Cork-Dublin return on a tank of petrol in the Mondeo.</div></p>

<p>I gave up on Yahoo a long long time ago. The ultimate bungee VP company that came up with so many great products and ideas but followed through on almost none of them. I wouldn&#39;t touch any new Yahoo web-app with a long shitty stick because I know it&#39;ll be canned 12 months later. <p /><div>The death of Yahoo Maps, once the absolute industry leader, is a case study in how Yahoo screws up. Brilliant piece on it over on <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/09/02/yahoo-maps-api-so-long-old-friend">Programmable Web</a>.</div> <p /><div>But then, every once in a while, as with <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/">Pipes</a>, Yahoo makes me smile and remember how &quot;My Yahoo&quot;was my home page for most of the 90s. It happened again last night with the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/nodejs/browse_thread/thread/90dde0c7ce9681e4">Open Sourcing of Sled</a> (and the rename to <a href="https://github.com/hueniverse/postmile">Postmile</a>). You probably don&#39;t know Sled but I played around with it a bit over the summer. It was a very neat, very responsive, list-making tool. The reason I was trying it was that it was built using <a href="http://Node.js">Node.js</a> and our next project is doing the same.</div> <p /><div>The <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/nodejs/browse_thread/thread/90dde0c7ce9681e4">Google Groups post about it</a> highlights the fact that Yahoo is still doing interesting stuff and doing virtual startups/skunkworks. The Open Sourcing of it is important for the Node community as there are very few complete end-to-end meaty sample Node Apps out there using<span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">MongoDB, Express, Socket.IO, Jade, JS, HTML5 and OAuth that people can learn from. This will hopefully be a showcase for what&#39;s possible using the latest in web tech.</span></div> <div></div><div>Whilst I am thrilled with the project going up on <a href="https://github.com/hueniverse/postmile">GitHub</a>, the fact that they are killing it internally in Yahoo tells the same old story. What is the future for Yahoo?</div></p>

 <p>As anyone who travels regularly know, 97% of Irish people are genetically incapable of boarding a plane quickly, efficiently or correctly. 
</p><p>The best example of this that I encountered was on a recent Ryanair flight to Stansted. The person in front of me got on the plane via the rear door, decided to pick the second-last seat, spent several minutes dicking around in the aisle with their bags and finally turns around and asks "oh did you want to get past?".
</p><p>You also see people with no hand-baggage queuing for a plane with assigned seating, before the plane has even landed. 
</p><p>So whilst the Steffen Method looks wonderful, the only way it will work here is if cattle prods were involved. I would love to see Ryanair try this. The cattle prods I mean.</p></div>

 <p>Looks like a fantastic deal from Rackspace. Pinged them but got no response yet.
</p><p>You&rsquo;d think Amazon in Ireland would jump on the opportunity to support Irish start-ups in Incubators after the PR disaster of the recent outage but I&rsquo;ve seen no supports from them apart from their global competition thing.
</p><p>I always feel that Rackspace has a very low profile in Europe compared to AWS. Could be a nice way to improve that (SeedCamp, iGap, etc).</p></div></p>

<p>So the kids complained about the removal of Sky. A lot. There are only so many Charlie and Lola episodes you can watch on YouTube, particularly the ones in Finnish. <p /><div>The intention was to get that very highly recommended Humax Freesat box on Amazon but it&#39;s bloody pricey and we weren&#39;t sure we needed all of the features. Then the very kind <a href="http://twitter.com/gpelly">@gpelly</a> on Twitter mentioned the hugely impressive Ferguson Ariva 120 Combo. I love finding absolute bargains that don&#39;t disappoint and this ticks both of those boxes. It is a FTA satellite receiver and DTT receiver. So it can handle Freesat and Saorview programmes. At 99 on <a href="https://www.satellite.ie/acatalog/HD_Ariva_120_Combo_Box.html#aFerguson120Combo">Satellite.ie</a>, it&#39;s a complete steal.</div> <p /><div>Ours arrived yesterday and already the kids are happier. I plugged a spare 500GB USB HDD into it and it does full PVR functionality too. You can watch DTT and record Satellite or vice-versa. It does 720p and 1080i and can upscale SD content. It has a LAN port, SCART and HDMI. I&#39;m intrigued by the LAN port. If they could add UPNP or SMB browsing then you have a pretty bloody decent streaming media player thrown in too. It&#39;s also tiny. Software upgrade is easily done using USB.</div> <p /><div>There is a <a href="http://www.boards.ie/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=2056284276">massivethread about it on boards.ie</a> with tons of support from Tony in Satellite.ie.</div><p /><div>The <a href="http://www.freesat.co.uk/">Freesat programme list</a> is not massive but is not bad. As it&#39;s not an official Freesat box, there is no EPG, so you only have now/next for the programme info. CBBC, CBeebies, CITV and daytime TV on some of the other channels should keep the kids from going completely mad.</div> <p /><div>I can&#39;t report on DTT performance as our aerial doesn&#39;t seem to be working right now. It is pointing into a tree in the general direction of the old Carrigaline repeater so I&#39;ll need to twist it to point to a local digital mast and test it too.</div> <p /><div>And all without any Rupert tax to pay. I&#39;m already thinking of getting a second one.</div></p>

<p>After our ongoing argument over the telephone connection with Sky TV, they doubled the multi-room charge, so we cancelled the lot in early August.Today the cancellation finally kicked in.<p /><div>The kids are in shock. </div><p /><div>We had planned to get a Freesat box but we&#39;re actually going to play it by ear and get nothing for a while. Let&#39;s see how they survive on the few stations they can get in &quot;Other Channels&quot; on the Sky box, along with BBC iPlayer, Hulu and YouTube.</div> <p /><div>I would say RTE Player too, but we don&#39;t watch RTE in our house except for the odd food show once every six months.</div><p /><div>Biggest holes are probably going to be Wizards of Waverly Place and Hannah Montana.The younger ones will be happy enough with CBeebies (by whatever route).</div> <p /><div>I still want to get a HBO subscription. Some day the US TV stations will figure all of this internet stuff out and put Rupert out of business.</div><p /><div>I&#39;ll report back after a week or so.</div></p>

<p><p>Sibal, our 7 y/o, just read a sample chapter of Judy Moody on my Kindle. Some of the words were beyond her and we made good use of the dictionary feature which is pretty decent.</p> <p>But it struck me that a &quot;Kid Mode&quot; would be 100x more useful. It would give a child-friendly pop-up explanation plus optional audio pronounciation. Basically what the VTech Storio does but at Amazon scale.</p> <p>Next logical step would be cool kid designs on the devices and a kid-only Kindle Store.</p></p>

<p>Or do we just have complete UI failure? </p><p /><div>And as for the &quot;You&#39;ve used 2GB of the 2GB on your 1Gb Plan&quot;, eh, no I haven&#39;t, I&#39;ve used 250MB.</div><p /><div>There is also a big difference between GB and Gb. 8x in fact.</div></p>
