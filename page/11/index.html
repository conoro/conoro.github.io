                        <p>#&ldquo;My Second Spring Cleaning&rdquo;</p>

<p>Were living in a new kind of computing environment. Everyone has a device, sometimes multiple devices. Its been a long time since we have had this rate of changeit probably hasnt happened since the birth of personal computing 40 years ago.</p>

<p>To make the most of these opportunities, I need to focus otherwise I spread myself too thin and lack impact. So today I&rsquo;m announcing some more closures, bringing the total to 70 Google features or services closed since my spring cleaning began in 2011:
<ul>
    <li>I first used <strong>Google+</strong> in 2011 in an effort to make it easy for me to discover and keep tabs on my favorite topics. While the product has a loyal following, over the years, my usage has declined. So, on March 14th, 2013, I retired Google+. Users and developers interested in alternatives can find me on <a href="http://twitter.com/conoro">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/conoroneill">Facebook</a>, <a href="http://alpha.app.net/conor">App.Net</a>, <a href="https://github.com/conoro/">Github</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/people/bandon1/">Flickr</a>.</li>

<p>I heard about the <a href="http://shrimping.it">Shrimping It</a> project a few months ago and loved it immediately. Based in Morecambe in the UK (hence the name), it&rsquo;s an initiative to get Arduino compatible boards in the hands of anyone for less than 2.</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t resist and ordered the necessary ATMega chip plus Xtal from <a href="http://ie.farnell.com/">Farnell in Ireland</a> along with the usual cheapo bits from <a href="http://dx.com">DX</a> in China.</p>

<p>You also need to splash out on a <a href="http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/USB-to-UART-TTL-6PIN-Module-Converter-buildin-in-CP2102-/250893154137?pt=UK_BOI_Electrical_Components_Supplies_ET&amp;hash=item3a6a65b759">CP2102 programmer</a> on eBay. Mine cost 2.08.</p>

<p>Last night I soldered the whole thing up, and amazingly for me, it worked first time. I added some headers to make connecting simpler and ran the <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/blink">Arduino LED Blink</a> example on it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be using this one for the next i-racer remote control that I build.</p>

<p>If you are interested in playing around with electronics or teaching your kids about it, I can&rsquo;t think of a better way to spend a fiver.</p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;A simple tool to bulk import your RunKeeper data into Endomondo&rdquo;</p>

<p>UPDATE 17th Aug 2013: The tool should now be able to import Sports Tracker files into Endomondo too.</p>

<p>TL;DR - <a href="https://github.com/conoro/runkeeper2endomondo/blob/master/runkeeper2endomondogui.exe?raw=true">Download</a> the Windows RunKeeper to Endomondo tool.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/conoro/runkeeper2endomondo"><img class="size-full wp-image-942 aligncenter" title="rk2em_01" alt="" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/rk2em_01.jpg" width="467" height="339" /></a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been using <a href="http://runkeeper.com/">RunKeeper</a> as my main mobile running app since January of last year. I liked it so much, I moved to the paid &ldquo;Elite&rdquo; tier pretty quickly. For almost a year, I really couldn&rsquo;t fault it and liked the social interactions with other Irish users along with its rock solid stability.</p>

<p>Then in December, it all went to hell. Whatever they changed in the Android App around the end of the year made a complete mess of the GPS tracking. Every run looked like I was a drunk Mr Incredible, staggering from one side of the road to the other in a single step.</p>

<p>I ran a bunch of tests and compared the data to other tracking apps like Google My Tracks. They confirmed that the problem wasn&rsquo;t the phone/OS/location/weather/time/mood or even the moon, the problem was RunKeeper. Even worse, my wife&rsquo;s RK on iPhone was showing similar rubbish data on the same route! Given the terrible mobile signal in Old Chapel, is it possible that RK&rsquo;s inability to live upload location actually trashes the location data itself?</p>

<p>After bitching and moaning for a few weeks and submitting a problem report, the RunKeeper people told me the all-new V3.0 should be better. And overall the accuracy was much improved, but now the altitude data is rubbish. And for some bizarre reason, they have removed functionality like the Map view in Android.</p>

<p>I expressed my annoyance in a status update on RK and was interested to find two other Irish runners who are equally annoyed by the problems of the past few months and RK&rsquo;s seeming lack of urgency with fixing the core functionality of their product. And we are all paid users, not freeloaders.</p>

<p>I decided to check out alternatives and quickly landed on <a href="http://www.endomondo.com">Endomondo</a>. Initial impressions are that the mobile app is nice but very laggy on a HTC Sensation, the web-app is dog-ugly but very functional and there are a <em>lot</em> more of my Facebook friends on it than on RunKeeper. It also seems to be more of a generic activity app and I like the challenges they set.</p>

<p>But then I ran into a problem. I&rsquo;m not moving Apps unless I can keep my running history. I keep a record of all my activity on a Google Doc spreadsheet but that obviously doesn&rsquo;t have the GPS data. RunKeeper have an excellent API and also provide a full dump of all your GPS traces as a zipped GPX file. The problem is Endomondo, it can only import one GPX file at a time. And life is too short for that nonsense.</p>

<p>So I sat down and decided to create a simple importer which takes all of your unzipped GPX files and concatenates them into one large GPX file which Endomondo can handle. Once imported into Endomondo, the activities all appear separately as you&rsquo;d expect.</p>

<p>I did my usual programming-by-Google-Search and found some simple generic Python GPX concatenation code (on GitHub, natch) which I had to modify to work with RK data. Of course I realised that the average runner is not going to be able to use a Python script with installation dependencies so I used <a href="http://www.py2exe.org/">Py2Exe</a> to build an executable. Then I realised that most people nowadays won&rsquo;t be comfortable with a command line app and I had a quick poke around <a href="http://qt-project.org/wiki/PySide">PySide</a>. A bit of messing with some example code and I had a nice GUI. Thennnnn I found <a href="http://www.pyinstaller.org">PyInstaller</a> which gives me a single windows EXE without needing an installer etc.</p>

<p>And so finally I get to the point. A simple Windows App which you point to a directory containing all your unzipped GPX files from RunKeeper and which generates a single endomondo.gpx file which you can import into Endomondo.
<h2>Converting from RunKeeper to Endomondo</h2>
<ol>
    <li>You export from RunKeeper as follows:
<ol>
    <li>Click on your name in the top right of the main screen</li>
    <li>Select My Settings</li>
    <li>Scroll down and you&rsquo;ll see a small blue link on the bottom left to &ldquo;Export Data&rdquo;</li>
    <li>Click that and follow the instructions</li>
</ol>
</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/conoro/runkeeper2endomondo/blob/master/runkeeper2endomondogui.exe?raw=true">Download runkeeper2endomondogui.exe</a></li>
    <li>This is a Windows Executable. You don&rsquo;t know me from Adam. Please run a virus checker on it after you download.</li>
    <li>runrunkeeper2endomondogui.exe</li>
    <li>Use the File menu to select the directory with all of your RK GPX files</li>
    <li>Currently the import only does those GPX files. So it is missing all of my manually entered treadmill runs (and there are a lot of those).</li>
    <li>My code is very rough and may show &ldquo;not responding&rdquo; as it grinds through larger files. It tells you what it is doing in the main window so just be a bit patient, particularly if you have an older PC.</li>
    <li>When it is done, you&rsquo;ll have a new endomondo.gpx file in the same directory as the exisiting files</li>
    <li>I&rsquo;ve read that Endomodo craps-out on files over 10MB, so if the endomondo.gpx file is bigger than that, you&rsquo;ll have to do this process in batches with sub-sets of the RK files. As a guide, my 47 GPX files including several half marathons and a full marathon come in at 4MB.</li>
    <li>You import into Endomondo as follows:
<ol>
    <li>Once my tool is done, go to Endomondo and select &ldquo;New Workout&rdquo;</li>
    <li>Select the &ldquo;Import from File&rdquo; option</li>
    <li>Point it to the endomondo.gpx file</li>
    <li>Endomondo will appear to hang when you do the import. Leave it running and then open another browser tab and check your activity history. When it is fully populated with the imported activities, you can then safely close the original browser tab.</li>
    <li>That&rsquo;s it, you&rsquo;re done</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

<p>The code has a few path dependencies on Windows but it should be trivial to change it to work on OS X and Linux.</p>

<p>All of the source code is, as always, <a href="https://github.com/conoro/runkeeper2endomondo">up on GitHub</a>, for you to change as you see fit</p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;OpenVPN on Windows 8&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m two months using Windows 8 64-bit on my desktop and I&rsquo;m still ok with it. The only real weirdness is a lot of disk churning even when nothing is happening. I turned off indexing but to no avail.</p>

<p>The only major annoyance has been OpenVPN. Whilst it works fine when it&rsquo;s on, the problem arises when I disconnect or shut it down. The routing gets all messed up and I cannot connect to any external site. The fix is to disable/re-enable the network adapter which is a total pain in the ass.</p>

<p>I did some searching but didn&rsquo;t find anyone else having the same issue. But I did find that there is finally [a] a new version of OpenVPN and [b] a 64-bit version. Even better, <a href="http://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/downloads.html">this official version</a> works with saved passwords, which the old one didn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been running it all morning and testing disconnect/re-connect. All seems fine. So if you are a BlackVPN or similar user and you are having Win 8 issues, give it a go. Obviously, like all other versions of OpenVPN, run as Administrator.</p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;Using a Wii Nunchuck instead of Cheese to control i-Racer RC car on @Raspberry_Pi and @Arduino&rdquo;</p>

<p><h2>Following up from the Cheese</h2>
After the enormous attention that the Cheese Controlled Car got, my thoughts moved to what else we could use with the i-racer. Two immediately came to mind: the Wiimote and a mousepad. But both went in directions I didn&rsquo;t expect. I&rsquo;ll write up the mousepad at a later stage but this post is about the Wii.</p>

<p>The Wiimote is an amazing device. I don&rsquo;t think the average person realises that it has a VGA infrared camera at the front, has a bunch of accelerometers inside and communicates with the Wii using Bluetooth.</p>

<p>The bit I didn&rsquo;t know until recently was that it also talks to the Nunchuck using I2C (I squared C, not I two C). This is a brilliant low-level communications protocol invented by Philips many years ago to make it very easy for inter-IC communication using just two wires. I spent a lot of the 1990s writing and debugging I2C drivers.</p>

<p>This made me realise I could dump the full Wiimote and just use a Nunchuck. Both Raspberry Pi and Arduino support I2C and there is tons of code on the web for both platforms.</p>

<p>TL;DR - If you want to jump straight to the outcome, here&rsquo;s a really rough video of it in action:</p>

<p>httpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEPdQ4GKqdY</p>

<p>Whilst there are <a href="www.sparkfun.com/products/9281">adapters out there</a> to get at the Nunchuck&rsquo;s pins, I decided to just cut the cable and go direct. A lot of our Nunchucks have rusty connectors due to the kids blowing on them to get a &ldquo;better&rdquo; connection. So they are basically spittle-filled. Gross I know.</p>

<p>A few minutes of soldering and I had the Arduino happily reading the joystick, buttons and accelerometer of the Nunchuck. But then I sussed that the simple serial Bluetooth dongle I had bought on DX to talk to the i-racer was Slave-mode only (HC-06) whereas I needed the more expensive Master-Slave one (HC-05). I managed to find the right one on <a href="http://www.elecfreaks.com/store/bluetooth-modem-minimum-passthrough-module-p-229.html">Elec Freaks</a>.
<h2>Using Raspberry Pi and Python</h2>
Whilst I waited for that to arrive, I decided to return to the Raspberry Pi and use that. Its I2C interface is available on some of the external PINs as follows:
<ul>
    <li>Pi pin 1 is 3.3V and connects to the Nunchuck Red Wire</li>
    <li>Pi pin 6 is Ground and connects to the White wire</li>
    <li>Pi pin 3 is the I2C Data Line and connects to the Green wire</li>
    <li>Pi pin 5 is the I2C Clock Line and connects to the Yellow wire</li>
</ul>
<a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_20130210_102511.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-931" title="IMG_20130210_102511" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_20130210_102511-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="438" /></a></p>

<p>Then you need to do some simple installs on the Raspberry Pi to enable I2C and access it with Python:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">
sudo modprobe i2c_dev
sudo modprobe i2c-bcm2708
sudo apt-get install i2c-tools
sudo apt-get install python-pip
sudo apt-get install python-smbus
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-bash">
sudo nano /etc/modules
</code></pre>

<p>Add these lines, save and reboot:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">
i2c-bcm2708
i2c-dev
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-bash">
sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/raspi_blacklist.conf
</code></pre>

<p>Comment these lines out with a #</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">
blacklist spi-bcm2708
blacklist i2c-bcm2708
</code></pre>

<p>If all is working well you should see 52 mentioned when you type this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">
sudo i2cdetect 0
</code></pre>

<p>(use a 1 instead of a 0 if you have a newer Raspberry Pi)</p>

<p>Then you can use Python like the following (courtesy of <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=44&amp;t=28231">sidb on the RPi site</a>) to report on what the Nunchuck is doing:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">
import smbus
import time
bus = smbus.SMBus(0)

bus.write_byte_data(0x52,0x40,0x00)
time.sleep(0.1)
while True:
 try:
 bus.write_byte(0x52,0x00)
 time.sleep(0.1)
 data0 = bus.read_byte(0x52)
 data1 = bus.read_byte(0x52)
 data2 = bus.read_byte(0x52)
 data3 = bus.read_byte(0x52)
 data4 = bus.read_byte(0x52)
 data5 = bus.read_byte(0x52)
 joy_x = data0
 joy_y = data1
 accel_x = (data2 &lt;&lt; 2) + ((data5 &amp; 0x0c) &gt;&gt; 2)
 accel_y = (data3 &lt;&lt; 2) + ((data5 &amp; 0x30) &gt;&gt; 4)
 accel_z = (data4 &lt;&lt; 2) + ((data5 &amp; 0xc0) &gt;&gt; 6)
 buttons = data5 &amp; 0x03
 button_c = (buttons == 1) or (buttons == 2)
 button_z = (buttons == 0) or (buttons == 2)
 print 'Jx: %s Jy: %s Ax: %s Ay: %s Az: %s Bc: %s Bz: %s' % (joy_x, joy_y, accel_x, accel_y, accel_z, button_c, button_z)
 except IOError as e:
 print e
</code></pre>

<p>You interpret the Nunchuck data as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">
Byte Description Values of sample Nunchuk
1 X-axis value of the analog stick Min(Full Left):0x1E / Medium(Center):0x7E / Max(Full Right):0xE1
2 Y-axis value of the analog stick Min(Full Down):0x1D / Medium(Center):0x7B / Max(Full Right):0xDF
3 X-axis acceleration value Min(at 1G):0x48 / Medium(at 1G):0x7D / Max(at 1G):0xB0
4 Y-axis acceleration value Min(at 1G):0x46 / Medium(at 1G):0x7A / Max(at 1G):0xAF
5 Z-axis acceleration value Min(at 1G):0x4A / Medium(at 1G):0x7E / Max(at 1G):0xB1
6 Button state (Bits 0/1) / acceleration LSB Bit 0: &quot;Z&quot;-Button (0 = pressed, 1 = released) / Bit 1: &quot;C&quot; button (0 = pressed, 1 = released) / Bits 2-3: X acceleration LSB / Bits 4-5: Y acceleration LSB / Bits 6-7: Z acceleration LSB
</code></pre>

<p>However, despite multiple attempts, I haven&rsquo;t been able to read reliably from the Nunchuck on the Raspberry Pi. An appreciable percentage of the data comes back as 0xFF. I have no idea if it&rsquo;s the wiring, the RPi CPU, the I2C driver in Linux, the I2C library in Python, timing or the code above. I don&rsquo;t believe the problem is the Nunchuck as I now have it working 100% reliably on the Arduino. In any case, the RPi was only ever going to be the proof of concept platform as we obviously need something more portable and less power hungry if we are going to chase a remote control car around the house.
<h2>Using Arduino and HC-05</h2>
Last week the HC-05 module finally arrived from China and I was able to start playing with it on an itty bitty <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardNano">Arduino Nano</a> yesterday. Using <a href="http://cu.rious.org/make/hc-05-bluetooth-with-arduino/">the basic instructions and code from here</a>, after a lot of misunderstanding what pin did what, I was able to connect to the HC-05 and it was able to connect over Bluetooth to the i-racer.</p>

<p>I pulled in <a href="http://www.windmeadow.com/node/42">the Arduino Nunchuck code from here</a> and converted my Raspberry Pi Python to Arduino Processing (basically a C variant). My code maps the wide range of movement in the Nunchuck joystick to the basic 6 degrees of freedom plus speed on the i-racer. It took quite a few hours of Googling before I finally sussed that &ldquo;arccos&rdquo; was the mathematical function I needed. So the code splits 360 degrees into 6 segments of 60 degrees. That gives us Stop/Right Forward/Forward/Left Forward/Left Backwards/Backwards/Right Backwards. Speed ranges from 0 to 15.</p>

<p><a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_20130224_1512541.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-935" title="IMG_20130224_151254" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_20130224_1512541.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600" /></a></p>

<p>It was a real delight to see the i-racer responding with no delay to my thumb movements but the code definitely needs tuning and I&rsquo;m pretty sure the Nunchuck is not giving a full range of motion. It&rsquo;s pretty ancient and so hard-left does not give the same value as hard-right for example.</p>

<p>Fionn was thrilled as I&rsquo;ve been promising him I&rsquo;d get it working for the past month! Interestingly, his first instinct was to use the accelerometer in the Nunchuck instead of the joystick. This must be how most Wii games work. It shouldn&rsquo;t be too hard to switch the code over to using the accelerometer but we&rsquo;ll use this for a while.</p>

<p>After a few more goes, both Fionn and Oisn pointed out that their natural action was to move the joystick in the direction they wanted the car to go, relative to them. I think I&rsquo;ll leave that for another day :-)</p>

<p><a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_20130224_1634171.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-936" title="IMG_20130224_163417" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_20130224_1634171.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600" /></a></p>

<p>Being able to run the whole thing off 4 rechargeable AA batteries is a real plus. I&rsquo;m also a huge fan of the <a href="http://shrimping.it">Shrimping It</a> project which is a minimalist Arduino setup using little more than the ATMega itself. I have two and the idea is to replace the Arduino Nano with one and make the whole thing even smaller again. The i-racer runs out of juice way faster than the remote ever will so I may be able to try AAA rechargeables or maybe a little Lipo battery.</p>

<p>You can find the <a href="https://github.com/conoro/iracer-controllers/tree/master/iracer_nunchuck_arduino">Arduino code on Github</a>.</p>

<p>Next up is probably a left-over Nintendo DS touch-screen as the controller. I also think we&rsquo;ll start adding &ldquo;headlights&rdquo; and an ultrasonic detector for collision avoidance. These will require changes to the i-racer firmware itself so you&rsquo;ll probably hear from me again in 2017!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been lucky to-date that I haven&rsquo;t killed the RPi stone dead with my little projects. I find the simplest way to help avoid any catastrophic shorts is to use an old 40-core IDE cable (note, the &ldquo;newer&rdquo; 80-core ones don&rsquo;t work even tho they fit). I Dremeled mine last week to fit in this <a href="http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Pi-Box-Case-Box-Enclosure-for-Raspberry-Pi-Computer-New-From-PiWorks-/390538699061?pt=UK_Computing_DesktopComponents_RL&hash=item5aedeba135">very nice inexpensive case</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_20130210_102511.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-931" title="IMG_20130210_102511" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_20130210_102511-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="438" /></a></p>

<p>In many ways, that GPIO header on the RPi is like the expansion port on the ZX Spectrum. So much possibility, so much danger :-)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m finding myself jumping back and forth between the RPi and Arduino a lot recently. Arduino is amazing because of the huge body of code and boards that are available. Interfacing to most things often just requires wiring it straight in and pasting some code off the web. In the picture above you can see an Arduino Nano which is both tiny and cheap ($10). Where Arduino falls down is when complexity is required. A 8-bit CPU can&rsquo;t just be connected straight to the internet or to a Bluetooth USB dongle. This means that some of the add-on boards (particularly Wifi) cost multiples of the Arduino itself.</p>

<p>TheArduinocode for Nunchuck worked perfectly first time, but right now I&rsquo;m waiting on a Bluetooth Master module from China to connect it to the i-Racer ($10 module vs $2 USB BT dongle). Whilst I&rsquo;m waiting, I&rsquo;ve been trying to get the Nunchuck working on the Raspberry Pi. I&rsquo;ll do a full post in a few weeks but suffice to say it has not been straightforward. Scanning I2C reliably with Python is proving a struggle and I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s HW or SW related. Having a Python runtime and Linux kernel between your code and the Nunchuck may not be the best for realtime performance. Compare that to the Arduino code which is raw machine code with no OS, reading its pins directly on a bullet-proof I2C bus.</p>

<p>There are many types of boards out there to make interfacing to the Raspberry Pi easier. They range from simple breakout boards converting male headers to female headers all the way up to big motor control boards with their own microcontrollers. I haven&rsquo;t bought any of these yet, so it&rsquo;s up to you to figure out what is most appropriate for your project.</p>

<p><a href="http://shop.ciseco.co.uk/slice-of-pi-add-on-for-raspberry-pi/">Slice of Pi</a>
Only 3.90, this is a breakout board which just makes it easier to connect jumper wires and less likely that you&rsquo;ll short anything out. One of its headers is XBee compatible. Probably worth getting no matter what you are doing. Very simple self-soldering to assemble and comes with all the parts</p>

<p>UPDATE 1 - 16/02/2013: <a href="http://shop.ciseco.co.uk/k002-slice-of-pi-o/">Slice of Pi/O</a>
Big thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/conorjh">Conor Houghton</a> for pointing out this board which I had missed. It is the Slice of Pi with an IO expander chip. The basic idea is that you communicate to the chip using I2C and it handles all the actual interfacing and buffering. So your RPi is much less likely to be damaged. If you damage the MCP23017 chip itself, you just pop it out and put in a new one for 1.53 from Farnell. Lots of info about it <a href="http://nathan.chantrell.net/20120602/raspberry-pi-io-expander-board/">here</a>. <em>This is in fact the board that I ended up buying</em>. It is only 7.89 delivered to Ireland which is in keeping with the low price point of the RPi itself.</p>

<p><a href="http://picru.st">PiCrust</a>
This is similar to the basic Slice of Pi but has more headers. However you have to order all the parts separately yourself. Still very inexpensive.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.adafruit.com/products/801">Adafruit Prototyping Plate</a>
This is the same idea again but with lots of connectors and plenty of space to permanently solder things on. $16 in US and I&rsquo;m sure someone is selling on this side of the pond too.</p>

<p><a href="http://ie.farnell.com/jsp/search/displayproduct.jsp?SKU=2218566&amp;CMP=SOM-FB-PiFace-Launch">PiFace</a>
This is more complex and has relays, motor control, switches etc. At 25 it won&rsquo;t break the bank and comes fully assembled. You can program in Python, C and Scratch. The last one is verrrrry interesting for something like Coder Dojos. I showed my RPi at Bandon Coder Dojo last week and got a ton of interest from kids and parents. Being able to do robotics in Scratch would blow a lot of their minds.</p>

<p>UPDATE 2 - 17/02/2013: <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11561">RaspiRobot Board</a>
This was <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/news/1074">just announced by Sparkfun</a> on Friday. It&rsquo;s specifically for robotics and seems decent value at $29.95. After you&rsquo;ve assembled it, it provides dual bi-directional motor controllers, two open collector outputs, two switch inputs and a voltage regulator capable of powering the Pi itself. A LiPo battery or 6 x AA batteries should provide the juice you need. Obviously Model A is the one to go with for robotics due to the much reduced power consumption.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cooking-hacks.com/index.php/shop/raspberry-pi/raspberry-pi-to-arduino-shield-connection-bridge.html">Arduino Shield Bridge</a>
This is a neat idea. It makes it possible to connect Arduino Shields (shields are the Arduino add-on boards) to your Raspberry Pi. Whilst boards like Wifi are expensive on Arduino, there are tons of control and interfacing boards which are very cheap. Things like Joystick boards, environmental sensors, heavy-duty motor control, RFID, XBee etc. They have created an Arduino-compatible library so you can use some of the same Wiring code on the Raspberry Pi that you would use on Arduino. Note that this can&rsquo;t work with everything but their site is good in explaining what will work. It is 40 which isstartingto get pricey for something which may only be suitable in a subset of cases.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/alamode-arduino-compatible-raspberry-pi-plate-p-1285.html?cPath=132_133">Alamode</a>
This takes the same Arduino idea and extends it further by basically giving you a full Arduino board which plugs neatly into the Raspberry Pi. You can see it as either adding Arduino functionality to the RPi or giving the Arduino very inexpensive Ethernet capabilities. However at $50, we are now at twice the price of a Model-A Raspberry Pi and many Arduino boards. So youreallyneed to be sure this is something you need and will use. I&rsquo;ve hooked Arudino up to RPi but only using USB. Clunkier, simpler but a lot cheaper.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.element14.com/community/docs/DOC-51726/l/assembled-gertboard-for-raspberry-pi">Gertboard</a>
This is probably the best known board as it was designed by one of the people originally involved in the RPi design. Whilst it is not &ldquo;the official board&rdquo;, many people see it as such. It is a very high end board with lots of functionality, particularly around motor control for robotics etc. It even includes the same ATMega MCU as an Arduino. Originallya kit, you can now buy pre-assembled for 30. My guess is that it will see the most community support due to its high profile. But like so many of the other boards I&rsquo;d point to the fact that it&rsquo;s more expensive than the RPi itself.</p>

<p>If I&rsquo;ve missed any others, please let me know in the comments. At the minute I&rsquo;m tending towards the simpler breakout boards. With a little care, you should be ok and they aren&rsquo;t adding much to the overall cost of the RPi. The power requirements of the Pi mean that using it for robotics etc probably isn&rsquo;t a runner for me and I&rsquo;ll stick with the Arduino for that. Ditto anything that I want to do outdoors. But for projects where you need to get the data online, an RPi is ideal.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;mparticularlyexcited by the idea of using Scratch to both interface to the real world and maybe even access the web. I wonder is anyone working on web services functionality for Scratch? I was disappointed that no-one did the same for <a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/">MIT App Inventor</a> and the<a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11343"> IOIO board</a>.</p>

<p>Actually, that reminds me I meant to blog about <a href="http://www.modk.it/">ModKit</a>. An absolutelybrilliantArduino project to bring Scratch-style/App-Inventor-Style development to that platform.</p>

<iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/42436411" width="400" height="300" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>

<p>You install a simple program on your PC and then do everything else in the browser (desktop app optional). It&rsquo;s amazing to drag a few blocks in a browser IDE which say &ldquo;blink LED&rdquo; and then the LED on the Arduino on your desk starts blinking! It&rsquo;s projects like this that will get kids interested in hardware and electronics big time. Perhaps it might eventually support RPi plus one of the boards above.</p>

<p>Like most people I&rsquo;ve had my phases in the past of analysis-paralysis. What-if, what-if, what-if?</p>

<p>I now try as much as possible to <em>just do it</em>. Have an idea, figure it out, create the first version, &ldquo;ship&rdquo; it, do the next one. If it works or is interesting, do the next one. If there is no interest or it doesn&rsquo;t do what you had hoped, drop it, do something else.</p>

<p>From Sean&rsquo;s <a href="http://seanbonner.tumblr.com/post/40185903436/new-blog-post-fuckitshipit">blogpost</a>:
<blockquote>The reason Woody Allen said &lsquo;Eighty percent of success is showing up&rsquo; is because eighty percent of people dont show up.</blockquote>
This isn&rsquo;t just for work. It should be how you do your hobbies, get fit, lose weight, change job, learn a skill, plan your vacation or deal with life&rsquo;s problems.</p>

<p>And as the manifesto below says:
<blockquote>Done is the engine of more</blockquote>
Point 12 below really resonates with me. I think I&rsquo;m banning myself from writing blogposts about how &ldquo;Someone should do X&rdquo; or &ldquo;Company Y should do Z&rdquo;. From now on, either I do X/Z or I STFU.</p>

<p>OK, enough righteous pomposity from me. The manifesto.
<ol>
    <li>There are three states of being. Not knowing, action and completion.</li>
    <li>Accept that everything is a draft. It helps to get it done.</li>
    <li>There is no editing stage.</li>
    <li>Pretending you know what you&rsquo;re doing is almost the same as knowing what you are doing, so just accept that you know what you&rsquo;re doing even if you don&rsquo;t and do it.</li>
    <li>Banish procrastination. If you wait more than a week to get an idea done, abandon it.</li>
    <li>The point of being done is not to finish but to get other things done.</li>
    <li>Once you&rsquo;re done you can throw it away.</li>
    <li>Laugh at perfection. It&rsquo;s boring and keeps you from being done.</li>
    <li>People without dirty hands are wrong. Doing something makes you right.</li>
    <li>Failure counts as done. So do mistakes.</li>
    <li>Destruction is a variant of done.</li>
    <li>If you have an idea and publish it on the internet, that counts as a ghost of done.</li>
    <li>Done is the engine of more.</li>
</ol>
But it gets better. James Provost expressed those 13 points using a Rubik&rsquo;s Cube:</p>

<p>And Joshua Rothaas made this cool poster. Both now printed and on my wall.</p>
