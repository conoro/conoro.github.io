<p>Twitter Emergency Rapid Response On-Site Reporting = TERROR <p /><div>No, acronyms have never been my strength.</div><p /><div>My CorkProbs idea on Twitter back in 2007 never got any traction. Mainly because there were possibly 10 people in Cork on Twitter at the time. The idea was simply that locals would tweet @CorkProbs about problems related to roads, electricity, gas, water etc and the account would re-tweet them. It was prompted by a water outage in Bandon where no-one in the Council could tell us what theproblemwas or take responsibility for finding out. The Twitter SMS interface was a big reason I thought it would catch on with normal people. Ah well.</div> <p /><div>I wasremindedof it again during the floods and freezing of November 2009. But it was really this winter where Twitter became the de-facto reporting system for weather, roads, floods and water outages. <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/iweatheronline">Irish Weather Online</a> almost made Met Eireann redundant in the past few weeks as we watched live reporting of the movement of snow across the country on <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23IWO">#IWO</a>.</div> <p /><div>I genuinely think Twitter has made the leap to being a Public Service Utility and should become a mandatory reporting system for all County Councils around the country.Of course being Ireland, we&#39;ll probably hire Bearing Point and pay them 100m to build a bad Irish knock-off of it instead.</div> <p /><div>I&#39;ve been building my list ofrequirementsfor anypoliticalparty to get my vote in 2011. I&#39;ve just added this to the list.</div></p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;What the hell ever happened to Twitter Annotations?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I got very excited earlier in the year when Twitter announced the Annotations feature. It&#39;s a way of adding metadata to a tweet such that it doesn&#39;t have to be user-visible. Of course the one use case that many of us thought of was reviews. You could add the rating, url etc as metadata and use the tweet for the summary. Then twitter clients could potentially interpret that and show reviews in Twitter with stars etc.<p /><div>But that&#39;s just one simple use case. Two others I was thinking of over Christmas were filters and hashtags.</div><p /><div>I know I know, my Filter Fetish continues unabated. But you could build a really effective filter tool if all of the Apps that posted to Twitter added some Annotations about themselves. So rather than clients trying to figure out that certain tweets are from Foursquare or Mafia Wars, apps would flag this in the attributes and you could mask all tweets from those sources with a single click. Like, <em>cough</em>, Facebook.</div> <p /><div>Hashtags are a wonderfully useful abomination. Such a simple &quot;feature&quot; provides incredible power for tracking topics but bloody hell, it can make Twitter an unreadable mess at times. Wouldn&#39;t it be so much better if hashtags went under the hood? The person or app generating the tweet would add the hashtags in a separate field (like tags in Wordpress) and they would be stored as annotations. Twitter clients could then hide them by default but make them visible if users wanted to see them.</div> <p /><div>There are so many useful ways Twitter could be improved using Annotations. It was announced at the <a href="http://gigaom.com/2010/04/14/twitter-launches-places-annotations-user-streams-for-developers/">Chirp Conference in April</a> but is still listed as &quot;not released to production&quot; <a href="http://dev.twitter.com/pages/annotations_overview">on the wiki</a>.</div> <p /><div>So what&#39;s the story Twitter? I find it hard to believe it is low priority, given how powerful a feature it could be. It would also allow a lot more normal people to feel ascomfortablewith Twitter as they do with Facebook. Is it proving hard to implement or scale?</div></p>

<p>Random brain-fart time. I jokingly suggested earlier that Twitter was just a front-end on the Skype IM system which is why both of them are down. <p /><div>Now I&#39;m sitting here thinking &quot;well ye know&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.&quot;</div><p /><div>Skype has the infrastructure, the contact lists and the userbase.</div><p /><div>Could they build both a single-threaded global system like Twitter with asymmetrical relationships and also a variation on their Groups feature, again where people can join rather than being invited?</div> <p /><div>I always remember that stupid but brilliantly compact line by Thesaurus Gillmor that Twitter was the new dialtone. Shouldn&#39;t that really be Skype&#39;s job?</div></p>

<p><p>Until my recent falling out with DealExtreme over their refusal to refund me for a returned item, I spent a lot of money on their site buying various gadgets and gizmos. The trick is to buy really cheap things so that if they break or aren&rsquo;t quite what you wanted, you can bin them or try and use them for something else. Hence I would buy replacement NDS parts, pens, USB cables etc.</p>
<p>This year I bought a few more expensive ($25+) items and most of them have been a disappointment. My falling out with them was over an MSI Bluetooth transmitter which decided to mess-up the entire raison d&rsquo;etre of Bluetooth by only working with other MSI devices!</p>
<p>The biggest let-down was a device that enables many USB devices to connect to a lan. They called it a &ldquo;<a href="http://www.dealextreme.com/details.dx/sku.20382">LAN-Storage UPNP USB/HDD/NAS/Scanner/Printer/Webcam Sharing Network LAN Server</a>&rdquo; and it cost $38. Its model name is the WLXKJ<span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">652.&nbsp;</span>So it has two USB ports and a LAN port. You can (in theory!) connect hard drives, printers, scanners etc and all can then be accessed over a network. The storage bit, in particular, looked really impressive. You can connect 2 USB HDDs (FAT32 or NTFS) and share them out both as network drives or UPnP shares. It&rsquo;s a mini-NAS basically. I loved the idea of it and had lots of plans involving hacked FONs and Nokia N770 tablets in a car.</p>

<p>The reality was a lot less impressive. It&rsquo;s basically single-tasking and freezes up if you look at it crooked. It also runs crazily hot. No matter what I tried to do with it, it screwed up. The forums on DealExtreme confirmed I wasn&rsquo;t the only one.</p>
<p>So in the back of the drawer it has laid for nearly a year, until yesterday.</p>
<p>I was trying to figure out a way of giving my most recently hacked XBOX access to media without [a] installing a big internal HDD or [b] needing a wired LAN. The idea is to set the XBOX up in the parents&rsquo; house so that any of the grandchildren could play ripped movies and tv shows. It was given to me by my brother-in-law to convert during the summer but I only finally got around to it now.</p>
<p>In the past I did this with a cheap EDIMAX wireless router from Dabs. I configured it to use WDS to the main router. So it plugged into the XBOX and then the XBOX seamlessly used it to connect to main router and the media shares in the house. It actually works really well. However it is a pig to configure and I wanted something more flexible.</p>
<p>A similar solution, which I tried yesterday, is to use a hacked FON router running DD-WRT in Client Bridge Mode. Here the router effectively acts as a wireless dongle to the XBOX. The theory seems solid but I couldn&rsquo;t get it working.</p>
<p>So I decided to give the Piece of Crap (PoC) another go. I very quickly ran into all the same problems. Lock-ups, disappearing off the network etc. Even worse, when it did work, the throughput on an NTFS HDD was so slow, the XBOX gave up.</p>
<p>The setup is really simple: Connect the PoC via lan cable to XBOX. Plug in USB HDD to PoC. Access USB HDD from XBOX as if it&rsquo;s a network device. I was ready to give up in frustration but decided to do a bit more googling.</p>
<p>And then I found it: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/snake-os/">SNAKE - Star NAS Altered Killer Edition</a>. A community-built mini stripped down version of Linux designed to run on the Star series of SoCs. As a guy with many years embedded experience I&rsquo;m embarassed to admit that it never struck me there was a SoC+RAM+ROM inside the wee box. The Star STR<span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">8132 (aka&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 15px; font-size: small;"><a href="http://www.caviumnetworks.com/ECONA_CNS2XXX.html">Cavium CNS2132</a></span><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">) is pretty bloody impressive. It&rsquo;s a 250MHz ARM CPU with on-chip Ethernet and USB.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Installing SNAKE was as easy as downloading the image and using the web-upgrade feature built into the box. Took about 3 minutes. And now I&rsquo;m a very happy camper indeed. I setup a generic share for one of the USB ports and configured the lan settings. And it just works. Perfectly. Reliably. Quickly!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">The only feature which seems to be missing is UPnP. But it appears to be easy enough to extend this software so I&rsquo;ll look at that soon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">So whilst I don&rsquo;t recommend buying one of these devices, if you have one, you now have something usable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">The really neat bit about this setup is that anyone with a USB thumbdrive or USB HDD can come along, plug it into the PoC and the XBOX will be able to access it without any re-configuring. The technically challenged in our family will love this. And since the XBOX itself has a DVD player, it really is a perfect (non-h264) media player.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;"><span>Last year I predicted that a glut of cheap phones would come out of China, all running Android. Chinese manufacturers seem to be ingenious at creating cheap silicon and hardware but truly awful at software. So if they used Android, that&rsquo;s a big problem solved. For the same reason, I wish all those Chinese companies building really smart hardware like the PoC would switch to Linux too. Then they can work with the OSS community to build some seriously kick-ass products.</span></span></p></p>

<p>Yeah it&rsquo;s stupid and I laughed when they announced it and strictly speaking it&rsquo;s only supposed to be available on Verizon, but I&rsquo;m now using Bing Search on my HTC Desire too. Nose, face, spite, etc.</p>
