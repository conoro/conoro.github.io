<p>I&#39;ve been making my own little client sign-up workflow inside Wordpress but there is a definite opportunity for someone to build a mini-workflow-engine for WP.<p /><div>Just pages/forms with strong conditional logic and branching and go-back. My kludge with a long page hierarchy, smart url naming and Gravity Forms will do in the short term but I could really do with the branching to separate pages based on input to forms (e.g. different billing selections). And not having to worry about url changes breaking the flow.<p /><div>So basically Documentum for (almost)free, re-written in PHP and in a couple of megs. Takers? C&#39;monnnnnnn.</div><p /><p /><p /></div></p>

 <blockquote><div>
 <p>Bernie Goldbach shares some of my misgivings regarding <a href="http://irish.typepad.com/irisheyes/2004/05/open_note_to_br.html#more" title="IrishEyes: Open Note to Brian Skelly">Mobhaile, the Local Government Computer Services Board&rsquo;s new public information initiative </a>. Most pertinently he asks -</p></p>

<blockquote>"What's wrong with rolling out an Irish-wide blogging system? The model has been tested since 1999 by several Irish bloggers. The back-ends are simple modifications of Perl, PHP, and scripted environments. There's no need to replicate document libraries or to deal with anything more complex than a MySQL database. The rabid uptake of this model across the world proves anecdotally and systematically how well-oiled and carefully grown micropublishing systems build effective communities.

<p>In the blogging world, affinity groups connect effortlessly. If the government provided the superstructure in the form of web hosting, occasional training, and cross-channel marketing, the results would work themselves. "</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Approaching my 2 year blogging anniversary I have to agree with these astute observations. I too attended the Mobhaile stand at last month's ICT Expo and saw very little that I imagined could not be easily replicated with the standard tools and services of the blogosphere.</p>

<p>I pointed out yesterday that if you @ someone in Buzz, it posts their email address in the buzzinga, which is mind-boggingly stupid. Techcrunch has now run with a similar story.</p>
<p>But the important bit is the Google response. Read it and weep.</p>
<p>They actually think that people only have one email address! Hell even my technophobic Dad and Mother-in-law each have two, one from ISP and one from GMail.</p>
<p>And they have obviously never heard of their own product known as GoogleApps.</p>
<p>I now understand why there are so many fundamental implementation errors in Buzz.</p>
