                        <p>#&ldquo;How do you get your Irish web business news?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Just had a conversation with our VP of Sales (to be announced soon :-)) about how people in Ireland working in web-related businesses get their industry business news. So not the latest web-app announcement or gadget but the business side of things. Who is selling what where. Who is doing new marketing campaigns. Who is doing deals with who. But specific to Ireland.</p>
<p>Is it still the business and technology sections of newspapers? Are there niche&nbsp;publications? Or has it all moved online? If you have a sec, can you let me know below? I figure this information is useful to us all.</p>
<p>Hmm, doesn&rsquo;t look like I can embed a Polldaddy poll here, so a link will have to do.</p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;Huge mistake by Google with Earth on Android&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Today Google released Google Earth on Android and it sounds impressive. But they have made a huge error of judgement in the release. It only runs on one phone, the Google Nexus One.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have just tried it on a G1 with OpenEclair (a community version of Android 2.1 which runs on the Nexus One). It installs but refuses to run. The only app of 30+ that I have tried which has failed to do so.</p>
<p>Quite apart from compounding the negative message they are sending to other Android phone vendors with the Nexus One launch itself, it looks like they are repeating all the mistakes of J2ME.</p>
<p>Android was supposed to be the realisation of the &ldquo;write once, run anywhere&rdquo; promise made by Sun for Java in 1995. Fragmentation of J2ME on mobile turned it into an unmanageable mess with software vendors having to generate potentially hundreds of variations of their apps for different phones. The alternative was to create lowest-common-denominator apps that worked everywhere but were totally hamstrung and ugly as hell.</p>
<p>Now here we are 16 months after the first Android phone and it is happening all over again. Millions of G1, Hero, Galaxy and other Android devices were sold in 2009. All of them run Android v1.x software. None of them can run Earth. None of them can run the mobile browser version of Buzz.</p>
<p>Google will tell you that it&rsquo;s the handset vendors job to keep the firmware up to date. I&rsquo;m a punter, I remember what it&rsquo;s like to wait for the Vodafone branded version of my Nokia N70 software, months after Nokia released it. It was annoying as hell with the operators then, it is just as annoying with handset vendors now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I buy an iPhone, my apps just work. Ok, they may not have any smut in them, but they work. If I buy a DVD, it works. If I buy almost any Windows application, it will run on W2K, XP, Vista and Win7. That&rsquo;s OSes spread over an 12 year period.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I install Google Earth on a Motorola Droid I bought in December, it won&rsquo;t run.</p>
<p>Of course OSes have to improve and evolve but Android has both backwards and forwards&nbsp;compatibility&nbsp;breakage. Apps written for v1.5 may not run on v2.0 and apps written for v2.1 won&rsquo;t run on v1.5.</p>
<p>This is a really really serious problem. Fix it Google or you will hit a brick wall in 6 months time when there are 40 handsets running 400 different firmwares and app developers and punters head back to the stable predictable iPhone platform.</p>
<p>I know I have re-considered my next Android device. Whilst Google might be happy that I would now default to the Nexus One since I know it will get the most support (as the G1 did before it), it does not bode well for other manufacturers supporting Android. With Samsung launching Bada and Sony Ericsson trying to support Android, WiMo and Symbian, it&rsquo;ll be a brave person who buys their Android phones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></p>

 <p>Looks like Google is starting to pull a Nokia on it by not supporting "older" v1.6 phones like, for example, the not-yet-released Sony Ericsson Xperia X10.
</p><p>Yeah yeah it's presumably due to HTML5 being needed. So release a v1.6x with HTML5. Oh, @Cyanogen already has. You do understand you have developer community Google, don't you? I thought that was the point of Android being "open".
</p><p>Off to boot into OpenEclair on the G1 so I can check out Earth.</p></div>

                        <p>#&ldquo;BMW 5-Series. Old or new for my Da?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>My Da&rsquo;s 12 year old BMW will fail its NCT unless he has 5 grand of work done on it so he has finally decided to get a new one. The new 520d and 525d are catching his eye. The advantage of the 525d is that it is available in March. The big disadvantage is a massive price uplift over the 520d. But he can&rsquo;t really wait until July for the 520d to be released.</p>
<p>The garage has some current model 520d&rsquo;s in stock and he is wondering should he just get one of them instead. I&rsquo;ve been doing some research and I think he should but then I&rsquo;ve never owned a Beemer so would appreciate advice from those in the know. My feelings are:</p>
<ol>
<li>He can get current 520d for a good deal if he negotiates hard (and waits for new shape to be launched)</li>
<li>Nothing reported about the new 5 Series would matter to him (new shape, 8 speed auto, better iDrive, better suspension)</li>
<li>After 5 years, the three models will all be very similar in re-sale price. In particular, the 520d-&gt;525d delta will have disappeared</li>
</ol>
<p>My only concern is that moving from 5L petrol to 2L diesel may be a leap too far for him. Some decent test drives on the new Waterford bypass should hopefully answer that.</p>
<p>How is the 520d for refinement,&nbsp;reliability, service cost etc? His old 7-Series is a lovely car but as reliable as a Trabant and spares cost a fortune.</p>
<p>Or should he consider Merc/Audi? He&rsquo;s been a BMW guy since the 80s when his job upgraded him from the vinyl-roofed Granada :-)&nbsp;</p>

 <p>My 4 media BFFs tell me that Irish blogging is dead, so Damien Mulley made up this list of fake blogs instead.</p></div>
