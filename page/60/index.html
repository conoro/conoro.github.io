<p>The horror that is broadband in West Cork means that heavy-duty internet-centric businesses willprobablyavoid being based here. However we did run into a little-known business advantage last week.<p /><div>We are prepping to exhibit LouderVoice at a major show in the UK soon (details to be announced shortly) and we contacted Enterprise Ireland to see what supports/grants they offer to companies doing this. It turns out that they usually pay 50% of any expenses incurred which is fantastic. It is also one of the few areas in EI that has not seen a major reduction due to its importance to export-oriented companies.<p /><div>However the EU did create one small glitch which is that companies in receipt of BES or SCS investment don&#39;t get the full 50% and we are one of those companies. If we were in Cork City (or Dublin, Kildare, Wicklow and Meath), the grant would be reduced to 25%. But because West Cork is seen as a &quot;disadvantaged&quot; area along with the rest of rural Ireland, we get a 40% grant. Score 1 for Bandon! Next they&#39;ll give us FTTH.</div> <p /><p /></div></p>

<p><p>From midnight to 7pm, Eircom broadband is actually pretty good. I now get a solid 6.1Mbs DSL connection on a 7Mbs line after clenaing up all the wiring in the house. But at 7pm&rsquo;ish every evening it collapses. I&rsquo;m not talking slow, I&rsquo;m talking 1993-era 14.4kbs type speeds and worse. Around 9pm we have nothing. 0bps. Contention my hole, this is a joke.</p>
<p>I always say that I can work anywhere on the planet as long as I have a decent internet connection. I&rsquo;m coming to the conclusion that Bandon along with Ulan Bator will have to join the exclusion list.</p>
<p>To combat thse probelms, I finally got my Mobile Broadband antenna setup with enough bandwidth to do the basics. I switch to this at 7pm every night now. However it does makes me feel like I&rsquo;m living in a mud hut in Somalia with a giant CB radio aerial trying to contact the next village to discuss water buffalo prices.</p>
<p>Here is the final fixed setup:</p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;Twitter tackling potential spam/abuse hard&rdquo;</p>

<p>I got a shock last night to receive an email from Twitter support to say that an OAuth Token we had configured had been suspended due to potential abuse.<p /><div>A quick explanation of what that means: When clients add <a href="http://www.loudervoice.com/">LouderVoice</a> customer reviews to their site, we provide the ability for their users to Login with Facebook and Twitter credentials and also to send a copy of their review to their Facebook or Twitter Account. Unlike many systems, we don&#39;t force clients to use our generic FB/Twitter setup but give them the ability to have it fully branded with their logos etc. To do this on Twitter you setup an &quot;App&quot; there. You may have encountered these as a user where an external application requests permission in a pop-up to access your account. This OAuth system means you never have to give your Twitter username or password to external sites. <p /><div>Generally we provide the instructions to the customer or their web development providers to set this up since it is very easy to do but sometimes, when under time pressure, we do it for them. Yesterday we did it for a globally known brand. And then we got the email!</div> <p /><div>I immediately guessed it was the use of the Brand name that was the problem and a quick email to Twitter confirmed it. They simply didn&#39;t see enough information in the App &quot;About&quot; fields to know that we weren&#39;t a bunch of spammers. I explained our relationship to the brand and offered contact names for confirmation and the Twitter guys then unlocked the app.</div> <p /><div>I&#39;m honestly delighted that Twitter did this. Whilst the spammers/bots are still driving us nuts on normal Twitter accounts, it appears that very close scrutiny is being placed on the API/Apps side of things. And rightly so.</div> <p /><div>We&#39;ll be updating our setup instructions so that the About info makes it very clear what the purpose of the Apps are and who is responsible.</div><p /><div>Good job Twitter!</div><p /></div></p>

 <p>There are many great tech journalists out there but only one has stuck in my head from the early 1980s to today and that is Guy Kewney.
</p><p>I devoured tech magazines all through my teens and 20s and had stacks of PCWs filling up my presses and then my attic. From that entire period, Guy was the guy. He always felt like the ultimate kindly British boffin. A style of person I will always admire.
</p><p>A lovely piece in The Register from John Lettice with a mention of the legendary Elan Enterprise which I would gladly have sawn my arm off to get. The ultimate vapourware.
</p><p>Guy Kewney, RIP.</p></div>
