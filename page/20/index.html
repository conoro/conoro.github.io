                        <p>#&ldquo;Facebook kicks Geni&rsquo;s butt for real family histories&rdquo;</p>

<p>A few years back, quite a few of us put effort into building our family tree on Geni. For a while I was a fan. Then someone connected two big trees via marriage and it has been a disaster ofirrelevant birthday notifications about people I have never heard of since.</p>

<p>Also, the constant upsells mean I haven&rsquo;t logged in for a very long time except to check the odd birthday.More importantly, all of the activity I have seen has been by my generation and younger. It is simply not on the radar of my parents.</p>

<p>For her 70th birthday, my Mum got an iPad from my Dad. After years of saying she would use computers when she could no longer do the garden, she is now online. She still gardens :-)</p>

<p>She uses the iPad for two things. One is the obvious family emails, usually links to pictures. The other I found out about last Christmas and is the real starting point for the title of this post.</p>

<p>She grew up in Ratoath, Co Meath, just outside Dublin. I lived there until I was 6. When we left in the early 70s, it was still a village. Over the past ten years it became the fastest growing town/village in Ireland. Despite the massive influx of people, there is still a core of the old villagers there, including my aunts/uncles and many of my cousins.</p>

<p>A few years back the Ratoath Heritage Society did a wonderful book called Ratoath Past and Present. I have a copy and loved trying to recognise people from my youth in it. There is a treasure trove of information in there but it naturally has a very limited distribution.</p>

<p>Back to last Christmas - Mum found out that there was now a Facebook Group dedicated to old pictures and stories about Ratoath. We spent ages trying to find it on the garbage Facebook iPad App and finally got to it using Safari.</p>

<p>The two of us spent the entire evening scrolling through all the pictures and seeing so many of my uncles as young men and my cousins playing GAA. It was an absolute delight. Huge kudos to Finian Darby who manages the group.</p>

<p>Now here&rsquo;s the really interesting bit for non-Ratoathers. My Mum now has a Facebook account. She has no friends on there and doesn&rsquo;t want any. The only reason for joining was so that she could join the group and see everything.</p>

<p>But it gets better. Over Easter I showed her how to Like a picture. Then I showed her how to comment. My Mum, commenting on Facebook. I swear I never thought I&rsquo;d see the day.</p>

<p>Finally, the bit that made me realise just how important Facebook has become for this type of history logging and community building. That group has many people in the US and beyond asking questions about their ancestors and who they might be related to. I see real joy when connections are made and information gleaned. They are both receiving and contributing to the knowledgebase around Ratoath.</p>

<p>A picture was posted recently on the Group which included my granduncle Oliver. His wife Ita died a while back, aged 90. No-one knew where the picture had been taken. Oliver, aged 92, was at death&rsquo;s door when Ita died but has somehow rallied and is now ok. Both his eyesight and hearing are failing. But someone decided to describe the picture to him and he was able to tell them exactly when and where it was taken!</p>

<p>A man who will never be on Facebook is feeding information to future generations which would otherwise be lost forever.</p>

<p>What Finian and all the locals are creating is an amazing repository of knowledge, memories and images. The open-systems person in me wishes they were doing it on a blog but it would never have happened that way. It&rsquo;s the people and connections on Facebook that make wonderful things like this possible and easy.</p>

<p>One of my regrets is that we never got my grandparents to talk about their youth and the past. Whether that oral history had been recorded in writing or tape, it would have been so valuable. On my Dad&rsquo;s side, all of the War of Independence stories would have beenriveting. On my Mum&rsquo;s side, all of the stories around Fairyhouse and Glascarn would have had many gems too.</p>

<p>If Facebook is the tool that facilitates this, then so be it. If they added some genealogical overlay features on the Social Graph, it would be curtains for Geni.</p>

<p>I look forward to lots more interesting pictures and stories being adding to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/47433132319/">Ratoath Past and Present</a>. I hope someone is doing similar for your home town.</p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;Google (and all of us) should revolutionise the interview process using @Sugru&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve interviewed many many people myself over the years and only hired two real duds in that time. Mostly I did it with gut rather than asking people to write code on a whiteboard or drilling them on software lifecycle. My aim was to get a sense of &ldquo;can I work with this person?&rdquo;, &ldquo;does it look like they have a creative streak?&rdquo; and &ldquo;have they any interest in software outside of work?&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Years ago, I even passed on the number one person in their year in Comp Sci in TCD because they ticked none of those boxes. They were just very smart, and I need a lot more.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know anything about the Google interview process apart from what I&rsquo;ve heard about the crazy number of sessions and the silly logic puzzles. If true, I&rsquo;d worry that you end up with a ton of people who all have a very similar profile.</p>

<p><a href="http://sugru.com/blog/google-commission-special-edition-sugru/">Sugru&rsquo;s post today</a>about how Google commissioned them to do branded Sugru for Hiring Fairs suddenly made me realise that Sugru could totally change the way we all do interviews.<img class="size-full wp-image-688 aligncenter" title="google-googru-5601" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/google-googru-5601.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="373" /></p>

<p>After the usual CV trawl with the person, hand them a few packets of sugru and a box of bits and pieces. Give them 20 minutes to do something interesting. If they come up with nothing, don&rsquo;t hire.</p>

<p>What better way to see if someone really does have the type of creativity that is critical in this business?</p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;ZX Spectrum 16k adjusted for inflation was \u0080461&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yesterday I finally got both MHL to the TV and Bluetooth to the Wiimote working with a ZX Spectrum Emulator on my HTC Sensation (video coming over the weeked). I was amused by the fact that I was emulating a cheap old computer with an expensive mobile phone.</p>

<p><a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Manic_Miner_Screenshot.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-685 aligncenter" title="Manic_Miner_Screenshot" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Manic_Miner_Screenshot.png" alt="" width="256" height="192" /></a></p>

<p>Then I wondered - How cheap was the Spectrum compared to the Sensation? Some googling for inflation adjusters later and I realised I was completely wrong. It wasn&rsquo;t cheap at all.</p>

<p>My original 1982 16K Spectrum cost 125 in WH Smith. Adjusted for inflation that&rsquo;s 377.50 which is 461! Ouch, I really had no idea. An unsubsidised Sensation on Expansys ischeaperat 439.</p>

<p>If my parents hadn&rsquo;t paid that serious chunk of money back then, who knows where I would have ended up in life&hellip;&hellip;.</p>

<p>UPDATE: All of which makes the Raspberry Pi a staggering bargain and utterlytransformational. Seeing someone on their site beg for early samples so he could show them to a African country&rsquo;s government is just one example of how important RPi is. Far beyond its technical specs or size.</p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;End of an Era - Philips switches off TV production&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whilst <a href="http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/philips-switches-tv-production">this story passed by</a> mainly unnoticed, I was very sad to hear that Philips is exiting the TV business. I have a lot of wonderful memories of working with the TV guys in Eindhoven and it pains me to see everything move to a JV in China.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.philips.com/"><img class="size-full wp-image-681 aligncenter" title="mainlogo_full_gb_en" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/mainlogo_full_gb_en.gif" alt="" width="148" height="39" /></a></p>

<p>My first degree-related summer-job in college in 1989 was in Eindhoven. My Dad knew a Dutch businessman who had connections in Philips and he got me a job in the Overseas TV department. The people I worked with were just amazing. They made TVs for places like South America where they had to handle every crappy signal that was thrown at them. This included not just poor TV signals, but rubbish power quality too. Those Philips TVs were the Toyota Landcruisers of the television world. Where everything else curled up into a ball and cried, your Philips kept on truckin&rsquo;.</p>

<p>I spent that summer running circuit simulations on a giant Computervision Workstation. Funnily enough, that was the summer I realised I&rsquo;d never be a hardware guy and totally moved my focus to software.</p>

<p>Come graduation in 1990 and I couldn&rsquo;t find a decent job so I went back into UCD and did a Masters in Speech Processing. In 1992, I emerged looking for a job once again. Luckily the first place I applied to was S3 in Dublin, 90% owned by Philips.</p>

<p>Mossie Whelan was intrigued that I had done summer work in Philips since he assumed every Irish person who did so, did it through him, as a Prof of Comp Sci in Trinity! In any case, the Philips thing must have helped and I got a job as a Software Engineer.</p>

<p>My first couple of years were spent working on GSM basestation software but then I landed a fantastic project, building the software for the first generation of Philips own MPEG-2 chipset. Up until then they had used SGS-Thomson chips. The work was tough as hell and we spent months in Eindhoven trying to get buggy silicon to display moving images. Finally, we cracked it and got the thing working. One of the happiest working days of my life.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll never forget a meeting a few weeks later where some Sony execs came in for a demo of the system in action. They were looking to use Philips as a chipset provider, despite being competitors in the TV space. Little did they know that we were manually restarting the software every 30 seconds or so from our giant Lauterbach emulator, just to keep everything moving!</p>

<p>After that we kicked off a much bigger project for the next generation of silicon but I never saw it deployed as I moved to Integral Design to spend the next 4 years working on Toshiba&rsquo;s MPEG-2 software.</p>

<p>But my admiration for Philips never subsided and the first big TV we ever bought with money from our wedding was a 32&rdquo; Matchline. Still my favourite TV ever.</p>

<p>So to everyone in Philips TV in Eindhoven, my lifelong respect.</p>

<p>The kids&rsquo; non-360 XBOX running XBMC has been an amazing piece of kit. We&rsquo;ve had it for over 4 years and got it second-hand for approx 60 but it maxes out at 480p content. I had thought that getting a replacement like the Patriot or WD Live TV would cost north of 80. But some geniuses have got XBMC running on the Raspberry Pi. A streaming media player with HDMI, LAN and 1080p support for 31 including VAT and delivery? Yes please.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>httpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NR57ELY28s</p>

<p>Also, someone has already beaten me to the punch by getting a ZX Spectrum emulator running on it. We need someone to make cases that look exactly like 48K Spectrums, including a working keyboard, that the RPi can slot into. Do it!</p>

<p>As we all patiently wait for the <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> boards to arrive, one smart individual <a href="http://russelldavis.org/2011/09/10/virtualbox-vm-for-raspberrypi-development/">has built a full VM</a> so you can try out the software in Virtualbox on your PC. I&rsquo;m downloading now and will report back on whether it runs on VMware Workstation and Player too. There are a few things I want to try out on Raspberry Pi and this setup will let me confirm whether they are feasible or not in advance.</p>

<p>Note that they are torrent links and if you are on Eircom, you won&rsquo;t be able to click the first one :-)</p>

<p>Speaking of torrents, <a href="http://alestic.com/2012/04/aws-s3-torrent">here is a brilliant tutorial on how to use Amazon S3 to seed files via Bittorrent</a>. This type of distribution of popular legal material makes so much sense.</p>

<p>UPDATE: It works perfectly in VMware Workstation (just use the relaxed settings when it complains and asks you). Check it out. Tingles!</p>

<p><a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/20120408-1322452.jpg"><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/20120408-1322452.jpg" alt="20120408-132245.jpg" class="alignnone size-full" /></a><br /><br />So far I really love the Fuji Finepix 4200 bridge camera. Barely scratched the surface of it but it&rsquo;s like being in a different century to our old point n shoots.</p>

<p>One obvious drawback of a non-cameraphone is that you lose Instant Upload to the web. It&rsquo;s a bit of a kerfuffle to remove the SD Card, power up a laptop and then upload.</p>

<p>Recently I got a dirt cheap USB adapter for the iPad on Deal Extreme in Hong Kong. I loved that you could stick a USB stick or similar into it to copy stuff into the iPad.</p>

<p>Today I had a brainwave. I took the camera&rsquo;s USB cable, plugged it into the iPad USB adapter and taa-daaaa, the iPad offered to import all the pictures on the camera.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a really really slick setup. Once I find out what the best photo editor is for iPad, I have the perfect mobile photo taking/editing/upload/blogging setup.</p>

<p>The only practical improvement I&rsquo;ll be making in the coming months is to get a sub-$100 7&rdquo; Android tablet to do the same. Without needing an adapter of course.</p>

<p>I got an email yesterday from Skype telling me that our account auto-refresh had been suspended. When I logged in, I saw the number above.</p>

<p>Panic.</p>

<p>A bit of checking and I realise that&rsquo;s 1 euro and 84.9 cents.</p>

<p>FFS, who the hell uses that format for currency, Latvia?</p>
