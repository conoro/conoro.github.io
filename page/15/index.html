                        <p>#&ldquo;My mind is blown - Met Eireann\u0092s radar image converted to #OpenData&rdquo;</p>

<p>Brendan Cunningham has just left <a href="http://conoroneill.net/bandon-flood-data-fews-now-available-on-cosmpachube/#comment-2311">the most exciting comment</a> this blog has ever received. He has thrown some serious smarts at the <a href="http://www.met.ie/weathermaps/Web_radar.gif">Met Eireann radar image</a> of rain and converted in to actual numbers you can use!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.met.ie/weathermaps/Web_radar.gif"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.met.ie/weathermaps/Web_radar.gif" alt="" width="360" height="347" /></a></p>

<p>That vector data with rainfall values is now up on <a href="https://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?docid=1E0Z4OTUfKXHzaLzFQT3aLlzJ-9LeWwcoCFyHsXk">Google Fusion Tables</a>and is updated every 15 minutes so now it can be integrated with GIS and other location based services.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?docid=1E0Z4OTUfKXHzaLzFQT3aLlzJ-9LeWwcoCFyHsXk"><img class="size-full wp-image-835 aligncenter" title="fusion" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/fusion.png" alt="" width="375" height="442" /></a></p>

<p>As he points out, with national coverage like this, you can watch for rainfall trends. Heck, you could even do predictions. He mentions that previous flood data may be available from the OPW and a Benefitting Lands layer from the OSi.</p>

<p>I pointed out to Brendan that this data may be perfect for <a href="http://openweathermap.org/">Open Weather Map</a> which has a radar layer for the US and Canada already. Hopefully there are no rights issues with the data (which I assume the Irish taxpayer has paid for). His follow-up comment seems to indicate that all is ok as long as it&rsquo;s not for profit.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s projects like this that give me hope for Ireland. Where the State is unwilling, unable or simply lacking in knowledge to release #OpenData, we can step in. Motivated, knowledgeable people with a community spirit can make the data we have already paid for, do more for the country.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m working on a small project in this area at the moment and have just received all of the hardware. Once it&rsquo;s ready, I&rsquo;ll publish the PoC here. I hope it will be of benefit to a lot of people.</p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;Sib\u00e9al, Fionn and S\u00edofra use littleBits for the first time&rdquo;</p>

<p>Last night, just before bedtime, I handed over <a href="http://littlebits.cc/">littleBits</a> to our three younger kids. They had never seen or used it before and I wanted to gauge their reaction to it.</p>

<p><a href="http://market.littlebits.cc/littleBits-Starter-Kit-_p_36.html"><img class="size-full wp-image-830 aligncenter" title="littlebits" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/littlebits.png" alt="" width="485" height="337" /></a></p>

<p>Overall they loved it and it was the first thing Fionn looked for when he got up this morning. Sibal also snuk off with it for a while on her own last night after the others had gone to bed.</p>

<p>The two favourite parts for all of them are the pressure sensor and the buzzer.
<p style="text-align: center;">httpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33AcI1gnwBE</p>
I love the concept and I think it&rsquo;ll be a huge help in kids understanding analogue electronics and getting an interest in it. However I do have a couple of worries.</p>

<p>The first is the most obvious - the price is 3x to 4x too high. We just could not justify paying $89 (<a href="http://market.littlebits.cc/littleBits-Starter-Kit-_p_36.html">Starter Kit</a>) for something that will probably not be used beyond tomorrow. Sibal&rsquo;s Android tablet was only slightly more expensive and will last her for a year or two. For a schoolroom, where it gets passed around, that price might be ok, but we honestly wouldn&rsquo;t buy it unless it was in the $20 to $30 range. Given that they have raised a bunch of VC, I hope they use it to re-align the price. I just can&rsquo;t see it getting mainstream adoption at the current level.</p>

<p>The second concern is more technical. There is only so much you can do with non-programmable analogue circuits (analogue engineers, please leave abuse in the comments :-) ). At some point it&rsquo;s going to need a digital controller and digital blocks. I don&rsquo;t know if this is in the plan or even in the design already. As an ex-Philips guy, I love seeing the adoption of I2C (I-squared-C, not I-two-C) by the Maker community many years after I used it in nearly every project. It strikes me as ideal for littleBits due to the minimal pin count and low speed.</p>

<p>The third issue is easy to fix. The head of the screwdriver is too big for the pots. Kids found it really hard to get it working. An extra 5 cents needed there I think!</p>

<p>Sibal is the main &ldquo;Maker&rdquo; in our house. She has that great combination of an interest in tech and an interest in art. Her plans for Halloween involve creating zombie costumes and using toggleable LEDs in ping-pong balls to scare people. I hope littleBits will encourage her two younger siblings to get equally interested.</p>

<p>One final note - at the start of the video I mention that littleBits is probably two simplistic for our older two boys but when Oisn (aged 10) saw littleBits last night, he insisted he had a go on his own today.</p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;Amazon Glacier looks ideal for cheaper long-term storage/backup&rdquo;</p>

<p>Amazon <a href="http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2012/08/amazon-glacier-offsite-archival-storage-for-one-penny-per-gb-per-month.html">just announced</a> <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/glacier">Glacier</a>:
<blockquote>Amazon Glacier is an extremely low-cost storage service that provides secure and durable storage for data archiving and backup. In order to keep costs low, Amazon Glacier is optimized for data that is infrequently accessed and for which retrieval times of several hours are suitable. With Amazon Glacier, customers can reliably store large or small amounts of data for as little as $0.01 per gigabyte per month, a significant savings compared to on-premises solutions.</blockquote></p>

<p>We use variety of backup and online storage approaches. Dropbox for commonly accessed data for individuals, S3 for backups/archival and S3+Cloudfront for CDN. There has been the option of reduced redundacy S3 for quite a while but we haven&rsquo;t bothered as we want the extra comfort level.</p>

<p>But looking at our S3 usage, the bulk of it is never accessed, it is only there for long-term archival. Old code, old server images, old documents etc. Some of it hasn&rsquo;t been touched in over 4 years. That&rsquo;s perfect for Glacier, which, based on its description, seems to be tape storage?</p>

<p>Just to give a simple comparison on pricing (storage only, not transfer):</p>

<p>S3: $0.125 per GB / month
S3 reduced Redundancy: $0.093 per GB / month
Glacier: $0.01 per GB / month</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll start the move in the next week or so.</p>

<p>I just used the Twitter API to get my recent Tweets.

                        <p>#&ldquo;First Hands-On with littleBits. Yes I&rsquo;m grinning a lot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lovely lovely people in <a href="http://sugru.com/">Sugru</a> sent me a <a href="http://littlebits.cc/">littleBits</a> kit and a great book yesterday. I have been intrigued by littleBits since I saw discovered it via the <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/">Adafruit</a> site a while back. Soon afterwards they raised bunch of money and I was pleased to see Ireland&rsquo;s own PCH involved in the production.</p>

<p>If you are not familiar with littleBits, it&rsquo;s a beautifully simple way of learning about electronics using parts which just snap together using magnets.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had a little play with it and it&rsquo;s great fun. However I won&rsquo;t give any detailed impressions until I let some of my younger kids at it. I want to see what they think. The opinions of a 44 y/o who did Electronic Engineering in college are less relevant!</p>

<p>In the meantime, here&rsquo;s a few pictures of <a href="http://market.littlebits.cc/littleBits-Starter-Kit-_p_36.html">the Starter Kit</a>.</p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;Why I&rsquo;ve pledged money to @AppDotNet and why you should too&rdquo;</p>

<p>There have been lots of concerns about the future of Twitter recently<a href="https://join.app.net/" target="_blank">. App.net</a>was recently announced as a pay-for alternative to Twitter with a powerful API, no ads and a deep commitment to not constantly change the rules on users and developers to suit an ever-changing business plan.</p>

<p>I always find it funny how people believe that the thing they are using now will never be replaced; from smoke to horses to telegrams to Friendster to Twitter. Creative and commercial destruction is inevitable and is often a good thing.</p>

<p>For $50, I think it is worth a try. Even as anhonourablefailure, if it shakes things up just a little or gets 10 more teams to try the same thing, then it&rsquo;s really a success. Also, if it doesn&rsquo;t succeed, you don&rsquo;t pay your money. The Alpha site which is built on their APIs is surprisingly great. Exactly like early Twitter with lots of chat and banter and not a snake-oil salesman in sight.</p>

<p>They are trying to raise $500k on <a href="https://join.app.net/">Kickstarter</a> by Aug 13th and at the current rate of progress, they will not meet that target. I&rsquo;ve already pledged the Developer Level $100 and have been using the &ldquo;Proof of Concept&rdquo; site, which they build in 2-3 weeks, for the past few days.</p>

<p>The lack of support on Kickstarter tells its own story. Not enough people see the problem. Possibly too busy reading about Justin Bieber. But give it time. I think the App.net guys should have waited for a crisis moment. The ideal time in the future will be when Twitter breaks API access for Tweetdeck AIR (and you know that&rsquo;s coming eventually). Then you&rsquo;ll really see the shit hit the fan with Power Users.</p>

<p>This blogpost has actually been swirling around in my head for months. I have been having deep issues with the direction of Twitter for a long time now and find myself genuinely worried about it.</p>

<p>I joined Twitter in February 2007. Apart from the 100 day war with Jaiku, I&rsquo;ve been a fanatic ever since, through good and bad. I have come to believe that Twitter is the most important advance in information dissemination since RSS, and possibly since the internet itself. Several year ago, Steve Gillmor nailed it when he said Twitter is the new dial-tone.</p>

<p>But here&rsquo;s the thing about dial-tones. When you pick up the phone in Bandon Oregon, your local phone company provides that tone and let&rsquo;s you talk to me in Bandon Ireland when I pick up the phone on an Eircom line.</p>

<p>A few more examples to bang you over the head with the point:</p>

<p>Email:</p>

<p>What they all share is an agreed standard that enables products and bits to be moved from place to place irrespective of the sender, receiver or shipper. They are robust, multi-vendor solutions, not, as Anil Dash would suggest, <a href="http://dashes.com/anil/2012/07/why-your-complaint-about-twitter-is-wrong.html">some hippie utopian open protocol</a>.</p>

<p>And now we come to the problem. Twitter is, and should be, the phone company. A solid staid infrastructure business. Unfortunately, Twitter wants to be the E! Channel, because their VCs think (rightly) there is more money to be made telling us what Kim Kardashian is doing right now.</p>

<p>To use as crass an example as I can think of: It&rsquo;s like Alexander Fleming discovering penicillin and deciding that he should focus on the lucrative blue cheese market.</p>

<p>And you know what, that&rsquo;s fine. Their site, their apps, their advertisers, their rules, their eventual Bebo-ification, MySpace-ification.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not going to prattle on about how Twitter has treated developers over the years. Building your entire business on someone else&rsquo;s API can only go one way, very very badly. I&rsquo;ll simply show you the email I got from them this week. The tone of that email tells you everything you need to know about the current mindset in Twitter towards third party developers. In summary, they screwed up but spend most of the email warning us not to screw up in the future. Or else.</p>

<p><a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/twitter.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-809" title="twitter" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/twitter.png" alt="" width="885" height="107" /></a></p>

<p>Fred Wilson has <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2012/07/in-defense-of-free.html">a good post on free ad-supported businesses</a> and equates Twitter to TV and magazine companies in this regard. He is clearly one of those who favours the E! direction of Twitter. But infrastructure companies don&rsquo;t rely on ads. Imagine having ads in the middle of your phone calls (wait, some bozos tried that didn&rsquo;t they?).</p>

<p>We pay for services that are important to us. Phone, internet, gym, monitored alarm, SMS. So why not realtime information?</p>

<p>Real-time messaging is too important to leave it to one company to screw up on their terms. Just as many early innovators were not the ones who properly exploited their innovations, it is time for others to build alternatives (plural) to Twitter.</p>

<p>For a microsecond I thought one alternative might be Google+ until I realised it was just Buzz without an API and with better SEO. Way back I also thought identi.ca might be a strong contender. Nope. And Facebook&rsquo;s search results can be 3 hours old, so that&rsquo;s a complete waste of time.</p>

<p>Another horrible thought I had on my holidays was that the ideal companies to build a distributed, multi-vendor, standards-based, realtime messaging system were the mobile phone carriers. Of course, they&rsquo;d charge you $1 per Tweet and it&rsquo;d end up as useful and interoperable as MMS. So let&rsquo;s quietly put that to one side. (Sidenote: I&rsquo;ve always been surprised Vodafone or similar didn&rsquo;t build a simple pure SMS-based Twitter clone. All theinfrastructureis there.)</p>

<p>And then we have <a href="http://daltoncaldwell.com/an-audacious-proposal">theannouncementof App.net</a>. $50 a year for no ads, a great open published API with a strong focus on a federated system and a belief that we can do better.</p>

<p>If I&rsquo;ve made you sufficiently concerned and you want in on something new and genuinely fun, <a href="https://join.app.net/">you can pledge your $50 here</a>.</p>
