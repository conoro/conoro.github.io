                    <div class="post-description">
                        <p>Back in 2011, I <a href="http://conoroneill.com/2011/11/17/bandon-flood-fews-open-data-now-available/">created a simple scraper</a> in Python to take the river level reported by the Bandon Flood Early Warning System every 15 minutes and save it in <a href="https://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?docid=103YIcARoxuaWT7NfZ8mVBzY554sF_3ONYC1N3DE">Google Fusion Tables</a>. In 2012, <a href="http://conoroneill.net/bandon-flood-data-fews-now-available-on-cosmpachube/">I extended it</a> to also save the data on <a href="https://xively.com/feeds/40004/?from_cosm=true">Pachube/Cosm/Xively/Fleeglrheumazoid</a> (or whatever insane name they have this week). So you have 2.5 years of river data in tabular and graphic form.</p>

<p>The code itself is very simple and just involved walking through the page (actually a bloody iframe!) to get the element I needed. But it&rsquo;s brittle, single use and runs on a home server behind the firewall. I also have a gap in the data in 2012 where I didn&rsquo;t notice that the cronjob had screwed up for 2 weeks.</p>

<p>Last week I heard about <a href="https://www.kimonolabs.com/">Kimono</a> and really liked the sound of it. You basically point it at any web-page and it gives you a version of the page where you can select elements and get API end-points for them. So any site that has info you&rsquo;d like to use or open up but where there is no existing API, can be API-ified. You need no coding knowledge to do this.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/kimono.jpg" alt="Kimono" title="Web Scraping" /></p>

<p>This has huge potential to generate even more Irish OpenData without relying on developers to do the work. Given how little data has been opened up here, either officially or by OpenData enthusiasts, this can only be a good thing.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;d like to access the Bandon River level programatically now, <a href="https://www.kimonolabs.com/apis/cr79egwi">it is here as JSON, CSV and RSS</a>.</p>

<p>As an exercise for the reader, why not try the truly hilarious <a href="http://maps.corkcoco.ie/planningenquiryv3/LAResources/info.aspx">Cork County Council Planning Enquiry System</a> which works best with Internet Explorer 5.5 or newer :-) Of course, the &ldquo;accept terms and conditions button&rdquo; does not work with Chrome. It looks like the same web gurus who designed Bandon FEWS also did this site, since both use 1990s-style frames, which Kimono does not handle at all. I just spent 2 mins playing with it and picked out the <a href="http://maps.corkcoco.ie/planningenquiryv3/enquiry.aspx">central frame</a>. But Kimono-ifying it gives a session timeout error by the CorkCoCo site. I think a small bit of effort could get this working. Any takers or do you all prefer to just talk about OpenData?</p>

                        <p>One small annoyance with the Baseline bolierplate in harp.js is that every blogpost needs to be listed in a file called _data.json with all the relevant metadata. Whilst it&rsquo;s not a huge job to slug-ify a title and add the ID and epoch time, it&rsquo;s sufficiently annoying to add friction to me blogging more. Here&rsquo;s the entry for this blogpost:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">
  &quot;a-simple-nodejs-script-to-setup-a-new-blog-post-in-harpjs&quot;: {
    &quot;ID&quot;: 1291,
    &quot;author&quot;: &quot;admin&quot;,
    &quot;date&quot;: 1403504847928,
    &quot;ptype&quot;: &quot;post&quot;,
    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;This little script generates the relevant metadata in the _data.json file including epoch time and optional Facebook thumbnail URL if you are using the Baseline boilerplate.&quot;,
    &quot;slug&quot;: &quot;a-simple-nodejs-script-to-setup-a-new-blog-post-in-harpjs&quot;,
    &quot;status&quot;: &quot;publish&quot;,
    &quot;title&quot;: &quot;A simple Node.js script to setup a new blog post in Harp.js&quot;,
    &quot;FBImage&quot;: &quot;https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/newpost.jpg&quot;
  }

</code></pre>

<p>This little script just generates everything you need once you tell it a title, description and image &ldquo;thumbnail&rdquo;. That latter piece is something I added to the _data.json &ldquo;schema&rdquo; so that when my posts are auto-shared to Facebook by dlvr.it, it&rsquo;s not the same image there every time but one of my chosing.</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">
// newpost.js
// Create all the metadata for a new Harp blogpost
// node newpost.js
// Uses and updates the _data.json file in your _harp directory
// It prompts you for the post-title, post-description and URL of an image that will appear when syndicated to Facebook

<p>Sourcecode <a href="https://github.com/conoro/conoro.github.io/blob/master/_harp/js/newpost.js">is on GitHub</a> as always.</p>

<p>One interesting side-note was how much effort it was to find a Node module that asks for user input in the way I needed. There are lots of modules out there for Q&amp;A and some of them make it very easy to ask lots of questions, but not one of them (not one!) is able to deal with input that stretches over more than the terminal width. All of them start overwriting what you write on the screen instead of scrolling up. That&rsquo;s a pretty staggering oversight by a lot of developers. Eventually I found the classic readline library which I have used in many languages over the years and it worked like a charm.</p>

                        <p>Whilst there are tons of tools to do S3 upload, I wanted something tuned to how I blog, particularly with a static blog that used to be a WordPress one with year/month directories for images.</p>

<p>Usage:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">node upload_s3_images.js image1.jpg image2.jpg image3.png etc
</code></pre>

<p>It uses your AWS credentials in ~/aws_config.json { &ldquo;accessKeyId&rdquo;: &ldquo;akid&rdquo;, &ldquo;secretAccessKey&rdquo;: &ldquo;secret&rdquo;, &ldquo;region&rdquo;: &ldquo;us-west-2&rdquo; }</p>

<p>It uses the bucket name and root upload directory from ./s3_blog_config.json {&ldquo;bucket&rdquo;: &ldquo;conoroneill.net&rdquo;, &ldquo;rootUploadDir&rdquo;: &ldquo;wp-content/uploads/&rdquo;}</p>

<p>So if I have a file called s3_upload.jpg on my Desktop and I invoke as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">node upload_s3_images.js ~/Desktop/s3_upload.jpg
</code></pre>

<p>I end up with a file at: <a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/s3_upload.jpg">https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/s3_upload.jpg</a></p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">// upload_s3_images.js
// Upload a space separated list of images to an S3 bucket for use by your Harp.js static blog
// node upload_s3_images.js image1.jpg image2.jpg image3.png etc
// Uses your AWS credentials in ~/aws_config.json { &quot;accessKeyId&quot;: &quot;akid&quot;, &quot;secretAccessKey&quot;: &quot;secret&quot;, &quot;region&quot;: &quot;us-west-2&quot; }
// Uses bucket name and root upload directory from ./s3_blog_config.json {&quot;bucket&quot;: &quot;conoroneill.net&quot;, &quot;rootUploadDir&quot;: &quot;wp-content/uploads/&quot;}
// My blog is exported from WordPress so it uses /wp-content/uploads/year/month/ as the directory stucture

                        <p>After 7 long years, Twitter finally added people muting recently. Meanwhile those of us who never use the official apps and use Janetter etc instead have had powerful keyword filtering for years. I see Twitter has some silly &ldquo;which team do you support in the World Cup&rdquo; nonsense now. But they really aren&rsquo;t thinking this through. There are many many many many people on Twitter who would happily never see a World Cup tweet. Why not make that happen as an opt-in but instead of just hiding them, replace each World Cup tweet with an Ad for something non-sport-related (in third party clients too). Finally a sustainable business model for Twitter. For the summer at least :-) You&rsquo;re welcome Twitter.</p>

                        <p>One thing I&rsquo;ve run into many times is the lack of internet bandwidth at events. It doesn&rsquo;t seem to matter whether it is a big pay-for thing or a BarCamp - once everyone was online, things slowed to a crawl. This was a really big problem at Dojo Camp last year where we had to get a ton of kids setup with the Arduino IDE and other tools. In the end it was faster to pass around a USB key but we lost a lot of valuable time doing this.</p>

<p><a href="http://piratebox.de/">PirateBox</a> has been around for ages as an anonymous drop box (not DropBox!). Basically it&rsquo;s software and configuration using dirt cheap TP-Link routers to provide a wifi access point with connected storage and files. Version 1.0 was just released which is a ground-up rebuild.</p>

<p>So at events you could tell everyone to connect to one or more of these PirateBoxes, where you and the various presenters/talkers have pre-uploaded all of the relevant material and assets, so they can be quickly accessed and downloaded.</p>

<p>In addition to file sharing, it also has chatting, message boarding, and media streaming. I&rsquo;d love to check out how many people it can support simultaneously.</p>

<p>As a <a href="http://piratebox.de/openwrt:diy">$35 self-build exercise</a>, it seems like a no-brainer.</p>

                        <p>Our 8yo wanted a local server on his laptop today so I grabbed the latest 1.7.9 server exe from the Minecraft site and ran it in its own directory. It created the usual files and gave a GUI-style interface with no obvious console like the raw Java version. Fionn then asked me to make him an Op so he could change things. And it was all downhill from there.</p>

<p>The standard ops.txt was missing but there was an ops.json containing just two square brackets. No amount of messing with creating an ops.txt or putting his username inside the brackets of the json file worked. Over an hour of googling finally got me close. In the recent versions of Minecraft, they have moved to using JSON instead of .txt for config files and they are rolling out the idea of UUIDs so that you can easily change your username. Both are reasonable changes but implemented terribly in this case. Unless the format of your json file in 100% correct, it doesn&rsquo;t throw an error, it just deletes it!</p>

<p>So after more than 10 attempts, this is what you need:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Find your UUID. Note that several sites claim to generate this for you but they are missing the dashes in the UUID. The one that worked for me was <a href="http://minecraft-techworld.com/uuid-lookup-tool">this one</a>. Enter your username and get something like 54d61e19-71cc-477d-8215-8a11c41f5211 back.</p></li>

<li><p>Edit ops.json in a text editor and replace the contents as follows:</p></li>
</ul>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">[
  {
    &quot;uuid&quot;: &quot;54d61e19-71cc-477d-8215-8a11c41f5211&quot;,
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;bobloblaw&quot;,
    &quot;level&quot;: 4
  }
] 
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>If you need more than one Op, do it like so.
<code>javascript
[
{
&quot;uuid&quot;: &quot;54d61e19-71cc-477d-8215-8a11c41f5211&quot;,
&quot;name&quot;: &quot;bobloblaw&quot;,
&quot;level&quot;: 4
},
{
&quot;uuid&quot;: &quot;44d61e69-6166-444d-8665-6a11567f5211&quot;,
&quot;name&quot;: &quot;mrsmines&quot;,
&quot;level&quot;: 4
}
] 
</code></li>
</ul>

<p>That should be all you need. Leave a comment if any problems with it.</p>

                        <p>I&rsquo;ve been meaning to go to 3D Camp since it first started. It has been about a lot more than 3D for many years. I finally did it on Saturday and had an absolute blast. I met people I&rsquo;ve been tweeting at since 2007 and really got the full BarCamp mojo whilst I was there. James Corbett, the organiser, was kind enough to mention that I helped to organise the first <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp">BarCamp</a> in Ireland with <a href="http://walterhiggins.net/blog/">Walter</a> and <a href="http://www.mulley.net/">Damien</a> way back in 2006. My only regret is that instead of a BarCamp in every town and village of Ireland every weekend, we now only have 3D Camp. I hope people will realise again soon how important it is to have regular free unconferences with no one hawking their wares, just sharing knowledge, the love of technology and what it can do for people.</p>

<p>OK, rant over, here&rsquo;s my deck. It&rsquo;s called <a href="http://conoroneill.net/3dcamp2014/">Hacking by Google Search - Building hardware with no electronics knowledge</a>. It&rsquo;s basically a summary of all the messing I&rsquo;ve been doing since mid-2012 when I got the electronics bug again. Anyone who follows this blog regularly will know most of it. But this one has animated gifs and some extra thoughts. It&rsquo;s also all HTML, done using a tool called <a href="http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/">reveal.js</a>. I really enoyed using this approach and it means it can be hosted on GitHub Pages, just like this blog. Well worth checking out for your own decks. You only need minimal HTML knowledge.</p>
