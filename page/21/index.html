                        <p>#&ldquo;Unofficial Mario Kart 64 on Android and an $89 Tablet&rdquo;</p>

<p>Two completely separate stories joined together nicely this morning.</p>

<p>First was the news that <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.n64.mario.kart">Mario Kart 64 now runs on Android</a>. I initially thought [a] it&rsquo;s an official port and [b] therefore it&rsquo;s an April fool. But I installed and ran it perfectly on a HTC Sensation running ICS.</p>

<p><a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/unnamed.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-652" title="unnamed" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/unnamed.jpg" alt="" width="705" height="345" /></a></p>

<p>Then I got an email from <a href="http://mp4nation.net/catalog/corepad7herotab-c8-capacitive-a8-s5pv210-android-23-p-486.html">MP4 Nation</a> in Hong Kong offering their Herotab C8 Android Tablet for $89. Yes, that&rsquo;s 66 for a 7&rdquo; multi-touchcapacitivescreen tablet with 512MB RAM, 4GBstorage, Wifi, HDMI, USB, USB OTG, microSD, 1.2GHz CPU and (sadly) Android 2.3.</p>

<p><a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/a7b6334ae015bfc95786997de16c8b76.image_.732x550.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-653" title="a7b6334ae015bfc95786997de16c8b76.image.732x550" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/a7b6334ae015bfc95786997de16c8b76.image_.732x550.jpg" alt="" width="732" height="550" /></a></p>

<p>Now this tablet is entirely generic and they even warn that it will probably have cosmetic nicks and marks on the body but it&rsquo;s 66!</p>

<p>My daughter was looking at the Nintendo 3DS in the Argos catalogue yesterday and it was 182. As for the PS Vita pricing, are they all on crystal meth in Sony? Not a hope.</p>

<p>Which do you think your kids are going to go for? An overpriced clunky web-clueless 20th century device with games that cost upwards of 44 a pop. Or a web-enabled handheld computer with hundreds of thousands of apps and games where most cost less than 5?</p>

<p>The perfect example of this is Scribblenauts which is 21 on DS and 79c on iPad. None of our kids play it on DS any more, as the 10&rdquo; screen on the iPad blows it away for playability. Yeah yeah I know Scribblenauts isn&rsquo;t on Android yet. But you get the point.</p>

<p>I know they won&rsquo;t do it, as they (like Apple), make a profit on their hardware, but at some point Nintendo is going to have to bite the bullet. The Sony Experia Play is the sort of thing they should be looking at but for a younger audience and with really great gaming controls.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s time for the Nintendo Andro-DS. It would offer the absolute best playability for DS games. They might go the route of locking the games so that they only play on their Android device and they also give owners access to the full standard Android market. But if they were really brave they would make the games available on all Android devices for 4.99 each. They should still make an Andro-DS as it would be the best way of playing the games.</p>

<p>Scribblenauts has sold 1m units on iPad. Mario Kart Andro-DS would sell 20m units easy.</p>

<p>Back to that el-cheapo tablet. Android 2.3 is horrible on tablets so it really needs to have ICS before I&rsquo;d consider it, no matter how cheap. There are some community ROMs out there but they all look very early-stage. If I could be sure ICS was coming, it is a no-brainer at that price. Still I&rsquo;m very tempted to take a flutter as it&rsquo;s a 1-day deal only.</p>

<p>Our 12 y/o son, named after the Grouch, not the playwright, has been making lots of funny short videos in the past year with his friends in the estate. But today&rsquo;s deserved a blogpost all of its own.</p>

<p>Watch and enjoy.</p>

<p>Tech notes: He uses a <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0038WATL2/ref=wms_ohs_product">Sanyo Xacti HD Camcorder</a>on a cheap tripod I got in Argos years ago. They then edit on a low-end laptop using <a href="http://www.pinnaclesys.com/PublicSite/us/Products/Consumer+Products/Home+Video/Studio+Family/Studio+Ultimate+15.htm">Pinnacle Studio Ultimate</a>. The lack of welly, memory and dedicated GPU in the i3 laptop is starting to become an issue for him so I&rsquo;ll probably be donating my self-built quad-core Phenom desktop later in the year. Particularly if they keep up the quality like this.</p>

<p>Also, not a bad English accent for a jackeen blow-in to West Cork aged 5.</p>

<p>The Revenue lawyers must have been wetting themselves with laughter putting this one together. From the new Form EII 1:
<blockquote>The amount of expenditure on research and development incurred by the qualifyingcompany in the specified relevant period ending in the year of assessment precedingthe year of assessment in which, in relation to the subscription of eligible shares, arelevant period ends, exceeds the amount of expenditure on research and developmentincurred by the qualifying company in the specified relevant period ending in the year ofassessment preceding the year of assessment in which the subscription for eligible shareswas made.</blockquote>
The <a href="http://www.plainenglish.co.uk/">Campaign for Plain English</a> hasn&rsquo;t made its way into Dublin Castle yet then?</p>

<p>XBMC&rsquo;s ability to play every file we throw at it, perfectly, is a daily joy. It is riddled with lovely useful touches like a slider to adjust the audio offset when your DVD rip didn&rsquo;t quite work perfectly.

There is a branch that includes recording functionality which I want to try but as it uses MythTV for the back-end, I&rsquo;m almost afraid to.</p>

<p>Its XBMC Flicks plugin for Netflix works pretty well on US Netflix but we actually just exit out and run Netflix in the browser for the more reliable UI.</p>

<p>If you have a PC which can connect to your TV with VGA/DVI/HDMI, XBMC should be the first thing you install.</p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;Mophie Juice Pack Air is perfect for Marathons&rdquo;</p>

<p>One of the niche problems with the iPhone 4 is full-length marathons. If you, like my wife, run 26 miles with music playing and Runkeeper recording all your stats, you will get to mile 25 and the battery will run out. Annoying to say the least.</p>

<p>I have tried a few el-cheapo chinese add-on battery packs that plug into the bottom but they rarely last more than a few weeks before going kaput. So a few months back in Dixons in Stansted I bit the bullet and handed over some serious cash for the 1500mAh <a href="http://www.mophie.com/mophie-juice-pack-air-iPhone-4-4s-battery-case-p/1145_jpa-ip4-blk.htm">Mophie Juice Pack Air</a>.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.mophie.com/mophie-juice-pack-air-iPhone-4-4s-battery-case-p/1145_jpa-ip4-blk.htm"><img class="size-full wp-image-637 aligncenter" title="jpa-open-right3" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/jpa-open-right3.jpg" alt="" width="339" height="310" /></a></p>
This is a full rubberised case with built-in lithium polymer battery. That battery tech is very cool as it doesn&rsquo;t need to be in the standard cell shape of traditional batteries. It means the phone ends up a bit taller, a bit wider and a bit thicker but not hugely.</p>

<p>She used it last weekend in Maratona di Roma and it lasted the full race and well beyond. A big big thumbs up from her.</p>

<p>Now all we need are the phone arm-band makers to up their game and start creating interesting ways of carrying these phones. The generic large Tune Belt strap we both use can barely fit a HTC Sensation or the iPhone+Mophie.</p>

<p>Sidenote: Mophie, blocking the right-clicking of images on your site because they are copyrighted has to be one of the most stupid anti-online-marketing things I&rsquo;ve seen in years. Also, it doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>

<p>Yes there are perfectly legal uses of Bittorrent. Like when the <a href="http://www.flood-tribunal.ie/asp/Reports.asp?objectid=310&amp;Mode=0&amp;RecordID=504">site hosting the Mahon Tribunal Report</a> melts down under the load and even the Irish Times struggles to serve it up.</p>

<p>If you download it via bittorrent, please seed for a while after completion to assist others. The more who seed, the faster it is for everyone. Thanks.</p>
