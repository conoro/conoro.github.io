<p>A few minutes ago, Google shut down Jaiku, just after I posted a #goodbye.</p>

<p><a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/17-01-2012-10-55-27.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-514 aligncenter" title="17-01-2012 10-55-27" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/17-01-2012-10-55-27-300x102.png" alt="" width="300" height="102" /></a></p>

<p>My last proper post there was 3 years and 5 months ago. For a short period in 2007, many thought it would overtake Twitter during the relentless fail-whale era, but it never got the traction.</p>

<p><a href="http://conoro.jaikuarchive.com"><img class="size-medium wp-image-513 aligncenter" title="jaiku" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/jaiku-300x247.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="247" /></a></p>

<p>I always said everything could have been different if Google had made it the Social Address Book in Android back in 2008. But siloed-thinking couldn&rsquo;t join the dots.</p>

<p>My full archive is now over on <a href="http://conoro.jaikuarchive.com">Jaiku Archive</a>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s too late to run any of the other backup scripts.</p>

<p>We should probably be as angry about Google not archiving this properly, as we were with Yahoo and Geocities, but obviously the scale is minuscule by comparison. And some of us have that archive above.</p>

<p>But do remember, what happened to Geocities and Jaiku could happen to Twitter or Facebook in 2015. So please make sure to install <a href="http://thinkupapp.com/">ThinkUp</a> somewhere so you can backup and own your own content.</p>

<p>I figured I&rsquo;d get the nonsense headline in before anyone else :-)</p>

<p>How many of these non-stories about the London Olympics are we going to see between now and the end of the year?</p>

<p>I had a great auld natter with Conn Muneachin last week all about the launch of Netflix in Ireland and the cobbled together home media setup we have in the house. It&rsquo;s amazing what you can build with some old gear, Cat-5e cable and Open Source software. Hope you enjoy.</p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;Apple to unveil revolutionary upgrade to multi-touch on iPad 3&rdquo;</p>

<p>In response to many complaints from users of the iPad 2 that the 8finger-2thumb gesture to switch between Apps was too simplistic, we can exclusively reveal that Apple will shortly announce their <strong>Multi-Toe Interface</strong>.</p>

<p>Recent research has shown that 82% of iPad usage is on the sofa in front of the TV. Apple further discovered that over 73% of people watch TV with their shoes off. New CEO Tim Cook joined the dots and Multi-Toe was born.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter" title="Multi-Toe" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-y3S0PtE5D7E/TxAz-Cm1uLI/AAAAAAAATkI/fNzYOw_YfTA/s640/IMAG0173.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="361" /></p>

<p>Now you can simulate the Android Back button by simply applying both hands and feet to the iPad simultaneously. Milton Bradley has already announced support in their upcoming iTwister game.</p>

<p>Rumours are also swirling that the follow-up iPad 4 will come with Bum-Touch where ass-dialling becomes a feature, not a bug.</p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;Changing over to a Bluetooth car stereo to work with your phone&rdquo;</p>

<p>I blogged about this before ages ago but had some recent questions on it so I thought I&rsquo;d do a quick update. If, like me, you drive an old car, your car stereo probably doesn&rsquo;t have an audio jack and almost definitely doesn&rsquo;t have bluetooth.</p>

<p>If you have a Ford from 1999 onwards then you have the added problem of a double height stereo whose CD player is probably knackered at this stage.</p>

<p>It turns out to be quite easy to replace any of the above with a dirt cheap stereo from Lidl or Aldi which gives you A2DP high-quality bluetooth audio through your car speakers when you pair your smartphone to it. As an added bonus you get an acceptable hands-free system built in too.</p>

<p>The steps are as follows:
<ol>
    <li>Buy one of the bluetooth units from Aldi or Lidl. I see <a href="http://www.lidl.ie/cps/rde/xchg/SID-2D79591D-3B4CF92F/lidl_ri_ie/hs.xsl/index_17063.htm">Lidl has one of them for sale</a> this Monday.</li>
    <li>Find your car stereo extraction keys or, if you can&rsquo;t, find 4 thin screwdrivers (jewellers ones work on many cars)</li>
    <li>You&rsquo;ll need two or threeadapters</li>
<ol>
    <li>The ISO audio/power one. e.g. <a href="http://www.incarexpress.co.uk/view_product.php?partno=PC2044">This one works</a> for Opel Astra</li>
    <li>The antenna one. e.g. <a href="http://www.incarexpress.co.uk/view_product.php?partno=PC5100&amp;gclid=CMm0me6x46..">This one works</a> for lots of cars</li>
    <li>Potentially a fascia blank-plate if you have a double-height Ford stereo. e.g. <a href="http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Ford-Focus-Fascia-Facia-Panel-Adapter-Plate-Surround-/250595006485?pt=UK_CarsParts_Vehicles_CarParts_SM&amp;hash=item3a58a05815#ht_2340wt_1139">this one for Ford Focus on eBay</a> (many sellers)</li>
</ol>
    <li>Pop the stereo out of the dashboard using the keys or screwdrivers</li>
    <li>Disconnect the cables at the back making sure none of them fall down into the bowels of the car</li>
    <li>Potentially remove the flimsy metal cage that held the stereo in if it was a third party brand e.g. the old Blaupunkt in my wife&rsquo;s Zafira</li>
    <li>Insert the fascia blank-plate if you have a Ford</li>
    <li>Connect power/audio to the new stereo etc using the ISO adapter</li>
    <li>Connect the antenna to the new stereo using its adapter</li>
    <li>Wiggle it all in. This can take a while. Mondeo as a doddle, Zafira was a horror</li>
    <li>Done!</li>
</ol>
Now you can pair your phone with the stereo and play all your music/podcasts.</p>

<p>Only word of warning is that the radio reception on our two Lidl/Aldi ones is rubbish in West Cork compared to the factory-fitted models.</p>

<p>I keep forgetting to blog this despite the fact that I wear it every day.</p>

<p>My mother-in-law got me a fantastic Christmas present in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/WildSideSports">Wild Side Sports</a> in Bandon.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a <a href="http://rusty.com/us/mens/Wired-Series/Wired-2011">Rusty Hoodie</a> with, wait for it, built-in machine-washable headphones!</p>

<p><a href="http://rusty.com/us/mens/Wired-Series/Wired-2011"><img class="size-full wp-image-498 aligncenter" title="Wired_r11110600_blk_f" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Wired_r11110600_blk_f.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="678" /></a></p>

<p>There is a separate pocket for your phone/MP3-player and a headphone plug in there. It runs up to the in-ear headphones which are actually the toggles at the end of the hood draw-string.</p>

<p>Not only is it a brilliant product but I will also single-handedly make hoodies the most uncool thing any teenager can wear. You&rsquo;re welcome.</p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;Cyanogenmod - The Community Android Firmware - Now 1 million users!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As a longtime <a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.com/">Cyanogenmod</a> user even I&rsquo;m a bit shocked by this number.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>We at CyanogenMod are thrilled to have reached 1 million unique and active users.Thank you.</p>&mdash; Keyan (@kmobs) <a href="https://twitter.com/kmobs/status/157380440796307456" data-datetime="2012-01-12T08:36:35+00:00">January 12, 2012</a></blockquote>

<p>In case you aren&rsquo;t aware of it, Cyanogenmod is a community built version of <a href="http://source.android.com/">Android AOSP</a> (Android Open Source Project). Every time Google releases a new version of Android, they release the source code shortly afterwards so that anyone can build a phone or phone software using it. There are hundreds if not thousands of community projects which take this code and port it in different ways to all the different handsets.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.com/"><img class="size-full wp-image-495 aligncenter" title="cyanogen" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/cyanogen.png" alt="" width="421" height="112" /></a></p>

<p>Cyanogenmod is the best known and usually the best. You get lots of great extra features, usually a speed improvement and most importantly, it excludes all those HTC/Samsung/Motorola bloatware UIs that those manufacturers insist on adding to their phones.</p>

<p>Cyanogenmod is also fantastic for getting the latest version of Android on to old unsupported phones. I&rsquo;ve even run Gingerbread 2.3 on my old HTC G1 which was the first ever Android phone.</p>

<p>But I&rsquo;ve always seen Cyanogen as a niche geek thing that would never have big numbers. I assumed the hassle of rooting your phone so you can install it was too much for most people. But 1m users is stunning. I could see this number going through the roof if a bunch of no-name Chinese phone makers use it and release $50 no-contract Android phones this year.</p>

<p>Well done to <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/cyanogen">Steve Kondik</a> and all of the Cyanogenmod teams out there. We&rsquo;re all eagerly looking forward to <a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.com/blog/cm9-progress-update">CM9</a> which is the Cyanogenmod version of Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich.</p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;My requisite Netflix Ireland &amp; UK linkbait post&rdquo;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been over 36 hours and I haven&rsquo;t blogged about Netflix launching on this side of the pond yet. Twitter was non-stop about it yesterday and rightly so. I&rsquo;ve seen every extreme of opinion expressed there so I thought I&rsquo;d lash down a few thoughts and findings.</p>

<p>We are probably the perfect target demographic for Netflix. We cut the cord on Sky back in September after we got sick of paying for a pile of old crap we never watched. Since then we&rsquo;ve used FreeSat and Saorview backed-up by Amazon Unbox downloads for US TV Shows (which requires a horrendous amount of messing so that you can give people your money) and some RTE Player, Hulu, TV3 Player and iPlayer. We adults have been happy enough but the kids have hated losing all their fave shows and struggle to live with just CBeebies, CBBC, CITV and RTEjr (and WTF is RTE doing with only showing RTEjr Mon-Fri? What is this, 1974?).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been massively looking forward to Netflix over here so that I could get all our fave US shows without paying the Rupert tax or messing with VPNs. The reality turned out a bit differently. There is almost nothing I could find in the TV section that was up to date. Damages was 2 seasons old. Ditto Weeds, Californication etc etc. I have to assume the existing buyers over here (RTE, Sky, BBC, ITV) have deals preventing Netflix from showing anything more up to date. I can only hope that they kick some serious arsein this space in the coming years and particularly block RTE from buying up shows that they never broadcast or only broadcast at stupid times.</p>

<p>Once I got over the disappointment I realised I still liked it. Firstly, they have a huge back catalogue. So even if they don&rsquo;t have the latest and greatest, you can find lots of stuff you&rsquo;ve never seen, particularly Indie movies or shows like Breaking Bad which I keep meaning to start watching. But more importantly for us, with 5 kids, the amount of kids TV is great. Lots and lots of stuff to keep them amused for months. Hopefully they&rsquo;ll add more Disney and Disney XD shows like Wizards of Waverly Place that some of our gang love.</p>

<p>For those reasons I think 6.99 a month is a bargain and I&rsquo;m pretty sure we&rsquo;ll keep the subscription after the trial month.</p>

<p>Now for the techie bits. I&rsquo;ve installed (or attempted to install) Netflix on the following:
<ol>
    <li>HTC Sensation running pre-release Android Ice Cream Sandwich - Perfect. Installed straight from Android Market.</li>
    <li>iPad - Had to turn on US VPN to get Netflix to even show up in App Store. Installed fine and runs beautifully. Presumably the usual App Store approval nonsense held that up?</li>
    <li>Nintendo Wii - Installed on two Wiis via the Wii Store. Works shockingly well, even if it&rsquo;s very slow to start up. This is the platform that the kids are using. Wiimote is the perfect remote control for it!</li>
    <li>XBMC on Windows - The XBMC Flicks pluginis currently not working for Ireland/UK but the community is working on it and it looks like a quick fix.</li>
    <li>Windows Media Center - Surprise surprise, won&rsquo;t install. Massive forum threads out there about US version problems so I&rsquo;m not surprised it doesn&rsquo;t work for us either. The thing about Media Center is that it&rsquo;s almost a brilliant app. Its DVB-S and DVB-T integration with full UK/Ireland TV Programme Guide is awesome but then it can&rsquo;t play AVIs in sync or show you your media in a simple folder list! Come on Microsoft, you should be at the centre of TV!</li>
    <li>XBMC on XBOX - Unknown. Not even sure if supported for US version. I&rsquo;ll check in the next few days</li>
</ol>
I also checked multi-streaming by playing a kids cartoon on the Android phone whilst playing Princess Bride on iPad and had no problems on 6 Mbs ADSL. That&rsquo;s on the low quality setting tho. I want to see what happens at higher res.</p>

<p>UPDATE: Just discovered that two Wiis cannot play simultaneously, which strikes me as a bizarre limitation given that iPad/Android was fine. We&rsquo;ll just have to get XBMC or Media Center working sooner!</p>

<p>My biggest complaint, and it&rsquo;s a major one, is the complete lack of fine-grained access controls. You can set an overall rating on your account from Show Everything down to Show Only G-Rating but that&rsquo;s it. I want to enable Everything on the PC whilst having the Wiis set to 12A or General. It&rsquo;s impossible. Netflix really needs to fix this. Right now I have the entire account set to 12A so if I want to watch Breaking Bad, I&rsquo;ll first have to change the parental setting online, then watch the show and then switch it back again. Netflix needs to either have sub-accounts with different access levels or just settings per device.</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s actually worse than I originally thought because even if you set 12A, it still displays all shows of all ratings in Browse/Search but just prevents you from playing them. Let&rsquo;s hope they don&rsquo;t offer Debbie Does Dallas for streaming. &ldquo;Daaaaaaad, who&rdquo;s Debbie and what is she doing in Dallas?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Apart from that huge hole, I&rsquo;m a fan. If all Netflix does is disrupt the incumbents, it&rsquo;s a good outcome for consumers.</p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;A Rural Irish School&rsquo;s App Inventor Pilot. The Story So Far.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Last May I started playing around with the idea of doing some sessions on <a href="http://appinventoredu.mit.edu/">Google App Inventor</a> in my kids&rsquo; Primary School. I&rsquo;d had great success trying it out with three of my own kids aged 12 to 7.</p>

<p>If you are not familiar with App Inventor, it is a way of building mobile phone applications for Google Android phones using a simple graphical blocks approach. It is highly suited to an educational environment and has seen a lot of uptake since its launch in summer 2010. It has recently been taken over by MIT and I expect great things from them in the coming year.</p>

<p>httpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ADwPLSFeY8</p>

<p>I am a member of the school&rsquo;s Parent&rsquo;s Association and I pitched the idea of me doing some after-school sessions with maybe 5th and 6th class in the Autumn. They loved it and so I contacted the headmistress and the teacher mainly responsible for computers in the school. Due to the summer holidays, nothing much happened until September except for me realising that after-school requires a very long Garda approval process whilst during-school doesn&rsquo;t. So we switched the focus to that.</p>

<p>A note on the school itself. It is a very successful rural school just outside Bandon, Co Cork with approx 25-30 kids in each year. The mix of kids (boys and girls) is everything from farmer&rsquo;s children to those who live in Bandon town itself. Socio-economically, it ranges from the very well off to those on social welfare. Every class has an interactive white-board and there are 15 laptops available in addition to the teacher&rsquo;s own. Most are PCs but there are a couple of Mac Books. However, there is no formal teaching of &ldquo;computers&rdquo;. More on this topic later.</p>

<p>Over the summer I made contact with somerelevantpeople and was delighted to get the loan of 15 HTC Magic phones to use in the pilot. However do not under-estimatethe amount of time needed to check that 15 phones work ok with App Inventor, have the correct settings turned on and are charged!</p>

<p>In the new term I met with some of the teachers and the new headmistress and they were very enthused. We put together a plan that would see me do a 30-minute session a week with each of 5th and 6th class from October until Christmas. The children would work in teams of two with a laptop and phone for each pair.</p>

<p>My big concern with the pilot was to ensure that &ldquo;no kid gets left behind&rdquo;. I knew those children who have PCs and even Smartphones at home would have no problems. I was much more interested in the ones who had neither and who had zero technical skills. I was also interested to see if App Inventor would work well for those who had resource teachers in certain subjects and even those who were on the autistic spectrum.</p>

<p>Basically, I had this idealised vision that our little pilot could help a bunch of kids discover the joy that comes from being creative in a technology sphere and maybe even give them job options in 8 years time that they had never considered possible. I know, I know.</p>

<p>I used the Google Apps for Schools system to create 30 GMail accounts for the kids which they would need to login to App Inventor. I took the first standard tutorial (HelloPurr) and re-wrote it to be much more simplistic. I made sure to get all the domains we needed allowed through the educational firewall. I installed Java and App Inventor on some of the laptops and the 5th Class teacher did the remainder in advance.</p>

<p>I headed in on the first day to introduce them all to App Inventor. The response was amazing. Every kid in both classes was totally pumped by the idea. They all immediately wanted to create Angry Birds, Zombie games and 3D games. Everyone seemed to be a Cut The Rope and Doodle Jump fanatic. It all looked good.</p>

<p>I put together a &ldquo;curriculum&rdquo; which would see us do two tutorials and then move to the kids coming up with ideas for their own Apps and then building them. The aim was to have a competition at Christmas for the best App.</p>

<p>Things didn&rsquo;t quite work out as planned&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>

<p>The first few weeks were hell. Both myself and the kids got very frustrated. And it was all down to the most basic problems that you never think about as a technical person but which can stop any normal person in their tracks.</p>

<p>In week one we didn&rsquo;t even manage to log every team into App Inventor. The problems included:
<ol>
    <li>Very few understood the difference between the address bar and Google Search</li>
    <li>Many had issues just getting the email address and password in correctly</li>
    <li>A lot of time was being wasted asking the children to type in long URLs to get to images etc and they would type them wrong or mis-capitalise things</li>
    <li>The Captchas stumped most of them</li>
    <li>App Inventor had huge issues with re-directing to blank pages and requiring page refreshes</li>
    <li>We finally realised that App Inventor is incompatible with Internet Explorer but that was all we had on every machine</li>
    <li>15 laptops logging into the same site on a school rotuer caused freeze-ups due to lack of bandwidth</li>
    <li>Logout/Login between 5th and 6th class was a nightmare of bad re-directs, cookies and browser cache</li>
    <li>Kids don&rsquo;t listen :-)</li>
</ol>
So we got Google Chrome installed on all of the laptops and things improved in week 2 (but not the blank screen issue).</p>

<p>Instead of us getting HelloPurr done in 2 weeks, it took us until late November. Each week I would have to jump from pair to pair, dealing with problems ranging from kids forgetting their email address, to Chrome problems, to phone connection problems, to mis-understandings. It was chaos. And none of it was their fault, it was mine for not realising how little most children know about the nuts and bolts of using software. Most of them know how to get to a web-site in IE8, that&rsquo;s all.</p>

<p>The Blocks Editor was a particular pain point and still is. It looks like we&rsquo;ll have to switch to Firefox to get it to launch reliably.</p>

<p>But the day we got HelloPurr running on 15 phones in each class was really special. All of them were delighted with themselves. They were beaming. I also pointed out to them that their use of a phone emulator in the previous weeks put them in a very small group of programmers globally.</p>

<p>In the last couple of weeks we have switched to doing the MoleMash tutorial. The reason for this is that it can form the basis for a wide range of games. Due to the previous chaos and the fact that we have most of the nitty gritty problems sorted, I am doing this tutorial as a classroom style lesson. I do each step live on the white-board and they copy me. I don&rsquo;t go to the next step until everyone says they have successfully carried out the previous one. The progress has been far better and on the 21st Dec, they all got the first revision of MoleMash running in an emulator.</p>

<p>One other advantage of this approach is that the teachers say they can follow things a lot better themselves. They were competely lost as I battled with Internet Explorer, the Blocks Editor and the Emulator.</p>

<p>The last two sessions were also an hour with each class instead of 30 minutes. I think we&rsquo;ll stick with this in the new year. We lose 10-15 mins of every session with login/logout problems and transferring 15 laptops between the classes. We had much more than 2x progress with the longer sessions.</p>

<p>The Google tutorials themselves are totally unsuitable for children of that age as they are far too information-dense and assume too much knowledge. A lot more hand-holding is needed.</p>

<p>With the Google shutdown and the delay before MIT is ready, I have created a private install of App Inventor for the school so we can continue. I expect them all to get the full MoleMash game running on real phones before the end of January. Then I think we&rsquo;ll do some variations on it so they can see how easy it is to modify. Then we need to explain some of the other key blocks and then maybe let them try their own Apps.</p>

<p>Whilst the sessions are exhausting I enjoy doing them. Particularly when the 6th class teacher told me that she sees kids completely engaged during those sessions who she has been unable to motivate in anything else. She also told me that certain kids who are struggling in school in general seem to shine doing App Inventor. Maybe I wasn&rsquo;t being so idealistic?</p>

<p>One big problem we have is that I don&rsquo;t scale. Committing to a day a week for months was unrealistic and I had to re-schedule a bunch of sessions. I always knew we&rsquo;d have to do &ldquo;train the trainer&rdquo; but I don&rsquo;t know if the school has other parents with the skills, interest and time to take part. I hope so. I&rsquo;ll be putting the call out soon.</p>

<p>We willstillhave our App competition with a prize, it&rsquo;ll just be months later than I expected.</p>

<p>The general lack of computing skills in Irish schools is pretty shocking and it tells me that it&rsquo;s time to wind down certain subjects and add &ldquo;computers&rdquo; as a subject at Primary level. Can I suggest moving allreligiouseducation to Sunday Schools like other religions do? Parents with the skills, interest and time could run those religion sessions. That would free up a huge amount of time to let schools do their real job.</p>

<p>Overall? A big success, loved by both kids and teachers. I just need to be more realistic with the timescales and the skillsets.</p>
