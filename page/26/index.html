                        <p>#&ldquo;My favourite new WebApp - IFTTT - If This Then That&rdquo;</p>

<p>I saw a bunch of mentions of <a href="http://ifttt.com">IFTTT</a> a few months back but didn&rsquo;t get a chance to try it out. It came up recently during a lovely lunch with <a href="http://twitter.com/johnpeavoy">@johnpeavoy</a> in the ever-impressive <a href="http://www.poachersinnbandon.com/">Poacher&rsquo;s Inn</a> in Bandon. I suddenly realised it could do something I&rsquo;d wanted for a year.
<div id="attachment_521" class="wp-caption" style="width: 450px;"></p>

<p><a href="http://conoroneill.net/my-favourite-new-webapp/23-01-2012-11-04-55/" rel="attachment wp-att-521"><img class="size-medium wp-image-521 aligncenter" title="23-01-2012-11-04-55" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/23-01-2012-11-04-55-300x243.png" alt="" /> </a>
<p class="wp-caption-text"></p></p>

<p></div>
The idea of IFTTT is simple but brilliant. It&rsquo;s has a hint of Yahoo Pipes stripped back to the core USP. It&rsquo;s all built around tasks which do stuff when other stuff happens (if THIS happens, then do THAT).</p>

<p>There are a ton of &ldquo;Trigger Channels&rdquo; like Twitter, Facebook, Dropbox, Foursquare, Google Reader, YouTube etc. Within each channel there are then Triggers like &ldquo;when I update my Status on Facebook&rdquo; or (and this is where I&rsquo;m using it) &ldquo;when I favourite a Tweet&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Then you choose an &ldquo;Action Channel&rdquo;, most of which are the same as the &ldquo;Trigger Channel&rdquo;. In my case I have two. The first is Delicious. So every time I favourite a Tweet, it get&rsquo;s saved as a Bookmark in Delicious.</p>

<p>I was actually going to build that specific usecase as a standalone webapp for myself last year. Now it&rsquo;s just one feature in IFTTT!</p>

<p>The other Action I use is to get the Tweet is emailed to me. This is ideal when I&rsquo;m reading Twitter on my phone when out and about. I generally don&rsquo;t read the links on the phone, so I favourite the Tweet and have it in my Inbox for later. You can also send them to ReadItLater or Instapaper.</p>

<p>The Task then runs every 15 minutes.</p>

<p>As I said, simple but brilliant. <a href="http://ifttt.com">Go have a play</a> , I guarantee you&rsquo;ll think of a bunch of actions. There are also lots of ones other people have created too.</p>

<p><a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/app-inventor-announcements/jTfW1d2OMxo">Thrilled to see</a> that the<a href="http://code.google.com/p/app-inventor-releases/">code is now available</a> for anyone to grab and modify. Once MIT is up and running well, they&rsquo;ll start accepting contributions.</p>

<p>My challenge to all the developers out there - port all of AppInventor to iOS. This would be far far more important and valuable for a child&rsquo;s education than some overpriced e-Books on a single vendor platform.</p>

<p>A few minutes ago, Google shut down Jaiku, just after I posted a #goodbye.</p>

<p><a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/17-01-2012-10-55-27.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-514 aligncenter" title="17-01-2012 10-55-27" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/17-01-2012-10-55-27-300x102.png" alt="" width="300" height="102" /></a></p>

<p>My last proper post there was 3 years and 5 months ago. For a short period in 2007, many thought it would overtake Twitter during the relentless fail-whale era, but it never got the traction.</p>

<p><a href="http://conoro.jaikuarchive.com"><img class="size-medium wp-image-513 aligncenter" title="jaiku" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/jaiku-300x247.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="247" /></a></p>

<p>I always said everything could have been different if Google had made it the Social Address Book in Android back in 2008. But siloed-thinking couldn&rsquo;t join the dots.</p>

<p>My full archive is now over on <a href="http://conoro.jaikuarchive.com">Jaiku Archive</a>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s too late to run any of the other backup scripts.</p>

<p>We should probably be as angry about Google not archiving this properly, as we were with Yahoo and Geocities, but obviously the scale is minuscule by comparison. And some of us have that archive above.</p>

<p>But do remember, what happened to Geocities and Jaiku could happen to Twitter or Facebook in 2015. So please make sure to install <a href="http://thinkupapp.com/">ThinkUp</a> somewhere so you can backup and own your own content.</p>

<p>I figured I&rsquo;d get the nonsense headline in before anyone else :-)</p>

<p>How many of these non-stories about the London Olympics are we going to see between now and the end of the year?</p>

<p>I had a great auld natter with Conn Muneachin last week all about the launch of Netflix in Ireland and the cobbled together home media setup we have in the house. It&rsquo;s amazing what you can build with some old gear, Cat-5e cable and Open Source software. Hope you enjoy.</p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;Apple to unveil revolutionary upgrade to multi-touch on iPad 3&rdquo;</p>

<p>In response to many complaints from users of the iPad 2 that the 8finger-2thumb gesture to switch between Apps was too simplistic, we can exclusively reveal that Apple will shortly announce their <strong>Multi-Toe Interface</strong>.</p>

<p>Recent research has shown that 82% of iPad usage is on the sofa in front of the TV. Apple further discovered that over 73% of people watch TV with their shoes off. New CEO Tim Cook joined the dots and Multi-Toe was born.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter" title="Multi-Toe" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-y3S0PtE5D7E/TxAz-Cm1uLI/AAAAAAAATkI/fNzYOw_YfTA/s640/IMAG0173.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="361" /></p>

<p>Now you can simulate the Android Back button by simply applying both hands and feet to the iPad simultaneously. Milton Bradley has already announced support in their upcoming iTwister game.</p>

<p>Rumours are also swirling that the follow-up iPad 4 will come with Bum-Touch where ass-dialling becomes a feature, not a bug.</p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;Changing over to a Bluetooth car stereo to work with your phone&rdquo;</p>

<p>I blogged about this before ages ago but had some recent questions on it so I thought I&rsquo;d do a quick update. If, like me, you drive an old car, your car stereo probably doesn&rsquo;t have an audio jack and almost definitely doesn&rsquo;t have bluetooth.</p>

<p>If you have a Ford from 1999 onwards then you have the added problem of a double height stereo whose CD player is probably knackered at this stage.</p>

<p>It turns out to be quite easy to replace any of the above with a dirt cheap stereo from Lidl or Aldi which gives you A2DP high-quality bluetooth audio through your car speakers when you pair your smartphone to it. As an added bonus you get an acceptable hands-free system built in too.</p>

<p>The steps are as follows:
<ol>
    <li>Buy one of the bluetooth units from Aldi or Lidl. I see <a href="http://www.lidl.ie/cps/rde/xchg/SID-2D79591D-3B4CF92F/lidl_ri_ie/hs.xsl/index_17063.htm">Lidl has one of them for sale</a> this Monday.</li>
    <li>Find your car stereo extraction keys or, if you can&rsquo;t, find 4 thin screwdrivers (jewellers ones work on many cars)</li>
    <li>You&rsquo;ll need two or threeadapters</li>
<ol>
    <li>The ISO audio/power one. e.g. <a href="http://www.incarexpress.co.uk/view_product.php?partno=PC2044">This one works</a> for Opel Astra</li>
    <li>The antenna one. e.g. <a href="http://www.incarexpress.co.uk/view_product.php?partno=PC5100&amp;gclid=CMm0me6x46..">This one works</a> for lots of cars</li>
    <li>Potentially a fascia blank-plate if you have a double-height Ford stereo. e.g. <a href="http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Ford-Focus-Fascia-Facia-Panel-Adapter-Plate-Surround-/250595006485?pt=UK_CarsParts_Vehicles_CarParts_SM&amp;hash=item3a58a05815#ht_2340wt_1139">this one for Ford Focus on eBay</a> (many sellers)</li>
</ol>
    <li>Pop the stereo out of the dashboard using the keys or screwdrivers</li>
    <li>Disconnect the cables at the back making sure none of them fall down into the bowels of the car</li>
    <li>Potentially remove the flimsy metal cage that held the stereo in if it was a third party brand e.g. the old Blaupunkt in my wife&rsquo;s Zafira</li>
    <li>Insert the fascia blank-plate if you have a Ford</li>
    <li>Connect power/audio to the new stereo etc using the ISO adapter</li>
    <li>Connect the antenna to the new stereo using its adapter</li>
    <li>Wiggle it all in. This can take a while. Mondeo as a doddle, Zafira was a horror</li>
    <li>Done!</li>
</ol>
Now you can pair your phone with the stereo and play all your music/podcasts.</p>

<p>Only word of warning is that the radio reception on our two Lidl/Aldi ones is rubbish in West Cork compared to the factory-fitted models.</p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;How could I forget the coolest Christmas Hoodie ever?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I keep forgetting to blog this despite the fact that I wear it every day.</p>

<p>My mother-in-law got me a fantastic Christmas present in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/WildSideSports">Wild Side Sports</a> in Bandon.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a <a href="http://rusty.com/us/mens/Wired-Series/Wired-2011">Rusty Hoodie</a> with, wait for it, built-in machine-washable headphones!</p>

<p><a href="http://rusty.com/us/mens/Wired-Series/Wired-2011"><img class="size-full wp-image-498 aligncenter" title="Wired_r11110600_blk_f" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Wired_r11110600_blk_f.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="678" /></a></p>

<p>There is a separate pocket for your phone/MP3-player and a headphone plug in there. It runs up to the in-ear headphones which are actually the toggles at the end of the hood draw-string.</p>

<p>Not only is it a brilliant product but I will also single-handedly make hoodies the most uncool thing any teenager can wear. You&rsquo;re welcome.</p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;Cyanogenmod - The Community Android Firmware - Now 1 million users!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As a longtime <a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.com/">Cyanogenmod</a> user even I&rsquo;m a bit shocked by this number.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>We at CyanogenMod are thrilled to have reached 1 million unique and active users.Thank you.</p>&mdash; Keyan (@kmobs) <a href="https://twitter.com/kmobs/status/157380440796307456" data-datetime="2012-01-12T08:36:35+00:00">January 12, 2012</a></blockquote>

<p>In case you aren&rsquo;t aware of it, Cyanogenmod is a community built version of <a href="http://source.android.com/">Android AOSP</a> (Android Open Source Project). Every time Google releases a new version of Android, they release the source code shortly afterwards so that anyone can build a phone or phone software using it. There are hundreds if not thousands of community projects which take this code and port it in different ways to all the different handsets.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.com/"><img class="size-full wp-image-495 aligncenter" title="cyanogen" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/cyanogen.png" alt="" width="421" height="112" /></a></p>

<p>Cyanogenmod is the best known and usually the best. You get lots of great extra features, usually a speed improvement and most importantly, it excludes all those HTC/Samsung/Motorola bloatware UIs that those manufacturers insist on adding to their phones.</p>

<p>Cyanogenmod is also fantastic for getting the latest version of Android on to old unsupported phones. I&rsquo;ve even run Gingerbread 2.3 on my old HTC G1 which was the first ever Android phone.</p>

<p>But I&rsquo;ve always seen Cyanogen as a niche geek thing that would never have big numbers. I assumed the hassle of rooting your phone so you can install it was too much for most people. But 1m users is stunning. I could see this number going through the roof if a bunch of no-name Chinese phone makers use it and release $50 no-contract Android phones this year.</p>

<p>Well done to <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/cyanogen">Steve Kondik</a> and all of the Cyanogenmod teams out there. We&rsquo;re all eagerly looking forward to <a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.com/blog/cm9-progress-update">CM9</a> which is the Cyanogenmod version of Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich.</p>
