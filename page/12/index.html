                        <p>#&ldquo;MaKey MaKey + Raspberry Pi + iRacer + Bluetooth = Cheese Controlled Car (CCC)&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Santa told me that he was getting an <a href="http://www.coolcomponents.co.uk/catalog/racer-p-993.html">i-Racer</a> remote controlled car for Fionn, I was very excited. This is a remote controlled car that, on the surface looks very crude. Heck it doesn&rsquo;t even come with a remote control.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.coolcomponents.co.uk/catalog/racer-p-993.html"><img class="size-medium wp-image-914 aligncenter" title="iracer" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/iracer-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s Bluetooth-controlled! You can install a simple Android App, pair with the car and control it either with on-screen controls or using the accelerometer in the phone.</p>

<p>As a standalone present it is pretty neat but like all remote controlled toys, I&rsquo;m sure would be discarded after a few days use. However Santa didn&rsquo;t want to spend a fortune on a full-blown Arduino-based robot platform or an even bigger fortune on Lego Mindstorms.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s when you start thinking about what is possible over time with the i-Racer that things get really interesting. Forgetting electronics for a minute, you could have huge fun making new shells for it out of different materials. Imagine a Foldify template for it so you could make printed paper shells. Lego might be a bit heavy but K&rsquo;Nex plus some Sugru could work very nicely. Or what about bamboo food skewers or ice-pop sticks? Maybe just some stickers.</p>

<p><a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/IMG_20121229_141040.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-919 alignnone" title="IMG_20121229_141040" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/IMG_20121229_141040-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="438" /></a></p>

<p>Then there is the code running on the car. The source is available so you can play around with it. Now this isn&rsquo;t the easiest thing in the world to do since the car is not Arduino so you need compilers and special programming dongles, but the option is there.</p>

<p>Taking that one step further, you could clip on other bits of electronics. I have a temp sensor, a PIR detector and an Ultrasonic distance detector all winging their way from China. You could use these to give the car a lot more &ldquo;intelligence&rdquo;. There is also someone working on porting the car&rsquo;s code to Arduino since the microcontroller is compatible.</p>

<p>But that stuff is hard and more long term and wouldn&rsquo;t actually involved Fionn doing much. Always have to keep your focus on the &ldquo;customer&rdquo;! So I thought about it some more and realised that you could have enormous fun with how you control the car. The use of Bluetooth gives you a giant range of pretty <em>cough</em> easy possibilities.</p>

<p>So I started playing with some Python code and after a ton of dead-ends, Linux bugs and system problems I was finally able to talk to the car from my Ubuntu PC with a $2 Bluetooth dongle. (Details below)</p>

<p>Then I realised that this would be no use over Christmas as we spend it travelling to family houses around the country without the Ubuntu PC. My Windows laptop should work with tweaks but that&rsquo;s not for games! So I started looking at the Raspberry Pi. Whatever problems I had run into on my PC were 10x worse on the Pi. (More details below)</p>

<p>After a ton of messing I got keyboard control working the way I wanted over USB on the RPi. Which leads to the piece de resistance - <a href="http://www.makeymakey.com/">MaKey MaKey</a> control. MaKey MaKey is a beautifully simple idea. It&rsquo;s an Arduino-compatible board you plug into a PC and it emulates various key-presses and mouse clicks. You then connect whatever you want, as long as it is vaguely conductive, and use that for input. It famously uses bananas, pencil drawings and buckets of water as inputs to various fun software.
<h2>The Cheese Controlled Car (CCC)</h2>
So Fionn finally had the ultimate car controller. 5 Pieces of Christmas Cheese connected to a Raspberry Pi via MaKey MaKey talking to a car over Bluetooth. Check it out in action:</p>

<p>Now for the nasty details. Whilst these steps are quite short and the code is very simple, it took a week of evenings cursing, hacking and googling to get everything working right.
<div></div>
<h2>Technical Nitty Gritty</h2></p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 1</strong>: Much improved code compared to the simple one below <a href="https://github.com/conoro/iracer-controllers">is now available on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>The main steps in getting the code to run were as follows:
<ol>
    <li>Figure out Bluetooth on Linux using<a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/albert/bluez-intro/x232.html">Bluez</a></li>
    <li>Figure out how to connect to car over Bluetooth using Python with<a href="http://code.google.com/p/pybluez/wiki/Documentation">PyBluez</a></li>
    <li>Sort out bad bug in Bluetooth on Debian (and therefore Ubuntu)</li>
    <li>Realise that most cheap micro Bluetooth dongles from China have duplicate MAC addresses and cannot talk to each other.</li>
    <li>Discover that Bluetooth dongle works on USB hub on Raspberry Pi at low-level but Bluetooth stack cannot see it. So connect it to one of USB ports on Raspberry Pi</li>
    <li>Discover that cheap Chinese Bluetooth dongles hang the Raspberry Pi after random amount of time</li>
    <li>Switch to using older bigger more expensive Bluetooth dongle</li>
    <li>Realise that Bluetooth dongle must be plugged in after booting Raspberry Pi in order for it to be detected</li>
    <li><em>Repeatedly curse the totally messed up implementation of USB on the Raspberry Pi</em></li>
    <li>Use a powered USB Hub to connect the MaKey MaKey and anything else like WiFi to the Raspberry Pi</li>
    <li>Figure out basic keyboard reading in Python</li>
    <li>Figure out reading keyboard in Python without carriage-return</li>
    <li>Try PyGame for keyboard reading but discover it needs a screen attached</li>
    <li>Figure out reading directly from USB with auto-repeat using<a href="http://gvalkov.github.com/python-evdev/">Evdev</a>and<a href="https://github.com/gvalkov/python-evdev">python-evdev</a>(must be run as sudo)</li>
</ol>
<h2>Installs and Tweaks</h2>
<pre><code class="language-bash">
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install python-pip python-dev build-essential
sudo apt-get install &ndash;no-install-recommends bluetooth
sudo apt-get install bluez python-bluez bluez-hcidump
sudo pip install evdev
</code></pre></p>

<p>Now you need to work around a nasty bug in Debian and Ubuntu. They have accidentally compiled in code for Nokia Series 60!</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">
sudo nano /etc/bluetooth/main.conf
</code></pre>

<p>add this line to it:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">
DisablePlugins = pnat
</code></pre>

<p>Now plug in the Bluetooth dongle, power up the i-racer and run:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">
hcitool dev
</code></pre>

<p>It should detect your dongle and report its MAC address. If it does, then run:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">
hcitool scan
</code></pre>

<p>This should find the i-racer as a Dagu Car. Note its MAC address and then pair to it by running:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">
bluez-simple-agent hci0 00:12:05:09:94:26
</code></pre>

<p>where you replace 00:12:05:09:94:26 with the MAC address of your car. The PIN is either 1234 or 0000</p>

<p>In a Python shell, (sudo python) run the following to find out your Keyboard or MakeyMakey ID:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">
from evdev import InputDevice, list_devices
devices = map(InputDevice, list_devices())
for dev in devices:
 print( '%-20s %-32s %s' % (dev.fn, dev.name, dev.phys) )
</code></pre>

<p>My MaKey MaKey comes up (with KB/Mouse/Joystick disconnected) as:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">
/dev/input/event0 Unknown USB IO Board usb-bcm2708_usb-1.3.3/input2
</code></pre>
<h2>The Code</h2>
Finally run this code as sudo to control the car using the MaKey MaKey:

<pre><code class="language-python">
import sys
import select
import tty
import termios
import bluetooth
import time
from evdev import InputDevice, categorize, ecodes

if __name__ == '__main__':

 dev = InputDevice('/dev/input/event0')

 bd_addr = &quot;00:12:05:09:94:26&quot;
 port = 1
 sock = bluetooth.BluetoothSocket( bluetooth.RFCOMM )
 sock.connect((bd_addr, port))

 for event in dev.read_loop():
 if event.type == ecodes.EV_KEY:
 key_pressed = str(categorize(event))
 if 'KEY_LEFT' in key_pressed:
 # 0x5X for left forward. 0x51 very slow. 0x5F fastest
 sock.send('\x5A')
 if 'KEY_RIGHT' in key_pressed:
 # 0x6X for right forward. 0x11 very slow. 0x1F fastest
 sock.send('\x6A')
 if 'KEY_DOWN' in key_pressed:
 # 0x2X for straight backward. 0x21 very slow. 0x2F fastest
 sock.send('\x2A')
 if 'KEY_UP' in key_pressed:
 # 0x1X for straight forward. 0x11 very slow. 0x1F fastest
 sock.send('\x1A')
 if 'KEY_SPACE' in key_pressed:
 #stop
 sock.send('\x00')
</code></pre>

<p>Note that this is extremely simple control with fixed speed just to prove the idea works. Real code will go up on GitHub when it has much more usable controls with automatic acceleration/deceleration etc and after I make it configurable with any i-Racer and with the MaKey MaKey on any USB port.
<h2>What&rsquo;s next?</h2>
Apart from extra sensors and new outer shells, I want to do more playing with controllers. I have an Arduino Joystick shield, Arduino Nano and serial Bluetooth breakout board coming from China. It&rsquo;d be cool to make some sort of interesting custom controller case with the Arudino controlling the car. I may also get an <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardEsplora">Arduino Esplora</a>.</p>

<p>The other really obvious one is to stick with the RPi and pair a Wiimote to it too. That could be the ultimate controller for the car.</p>

<p>One downside of the i-Racer is that <a href="http://www.arexx.com.cn/ch/ProductShow.asp?ID=120">Arexx</a>, the Chinese manufacturers, have not released the source-code to their Android App, only to the car software itself. Given how trivially simple the control protocol is, it should be very easy for someone to create Open Source equivalents for Android and iOS or even WP8 or BB10. I&rsquo;m currently poking around inside PhoneGap&rsquo;s Bluetooth support (<a href="https://github.com/huseyinkozan/phonegap-bluetooth/blob/master/README_EN.md">this plugin</a>) to see if a simple cross-platform Mobile Hybrid App could be created.</p>

<p>If this is a success, with success being defined as Fionn remaining interested, then I&rsquo;ll bite the bullet and start getting the parts for one of the good Arduino robot kits out there. A good intermediate step might be the <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11012">Sparkfun Protosnap Minibot Kit</a>. After that, the sky is the limit:</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/walter">Walter</a> has just posted his <a href="https://github.com/walterhiggins/ScriptCraft">ScriptCraft code to GitHub</a>. This Minecraft <a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Mods">mod</a> lets you create buildings etc using only Javascript. Very very cool indeed. I&rsquo;ll be trying it out later with some of the kids. My Minecraft experience is minimal so I&rsquo;ll let them guide me.</p>

<p>He has included an example cottage script which should be a good starting point for a lot of people.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re all guilty of under-estimating how hard it is to do other people&rsquo;s jobs. After reading <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/blog/2012/12/05/how-we-built-a-super-nintendo-out-of-a-wireless-keyboard-sifteo-sifteo/">M. Elizabeth Scott&rsquo;s fabulously detailed blogpost</a> on Adafruit about the creation of Sifteo&rsquo;s second generation toy, I&rsquo;ll never do that about toy makers again!</p>

<p>The post dives deep, real deep. As an old Embedded Fart, I revelled in every little detail.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.sifteo.com/">Sifteo</a> itself is still out of our price range but I hope that&rsquo;ll change as the volumes grow. It&rsquo;s a really interesting idea:</p>

<blockquote>The more creative programmer will only be limited by their imagination. Want to build a digital clock into the wall of your house which displays the real time? Easy. Want to get back at a friend who stole your precious diamonds? Remove the floor from underneath their feet and let them fall into a pit of lava. The possibilities are endless.</blockquote>

<p>If the future is mobile, then is Pocket Minecraft on Raspberry Pi = the Tween replacement for Twitter?</p>

<p>This is a big deal. I can&rsquo;t wait to try it.</p>

<p>UPDATE 1: I just realised the GPIO pins on the RPi mean that it should be possible to connect haptic/gesture/wiimote/any interfaces to Minecraft. Or have people been doing that already on the PC version? I&rsquo;ve just ordered a Makey Makey and you could have huge fun with that.</p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;Conor&rsquo;s 2012 @Raspberry_Pi Christmas Gift Guide&rdquo;</p>

<p>This post was prompted by <a href="http://twitter.com/mollydot">@mollydot</a> asking me last night on Twitter what accessories make sense if you are buying a <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> as a Christmas Gift and<a href="http://twitter.com/jkeyes">@jkeyes</a>rightly suggesting that a post with links would be useful.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/"><img class="size-full wp-image-905 aligncenter" title="santa_pi" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/santa_pi.png" alt="" width="600" height="399" /></a></p>

<p>I really think this Christmas could be a lovely replay of 1982 for a lot of people, like me, who got their first home computer that year. You could have so much fun on Christmas Day messing with the RPi rather than falling asleep in front of the fire. Just don&rsquo;t fight over who gets the telly when Doctor Who is on.</p>

<p>Whilst the bare-bones nature of the Raspberry Pi is wonderful, it is unusable out of the box unless you are a house with smartphones,digitalcameras and existing PCs already that you can raid for components.</p>

<p>What you want to avoid is a repeat of me that December in 1982 with my brand-new 16K ZX Spectrum which didn&rsquo;t work on our Nordmende TV until two weeks later when the RTV Rentals guy came and replaced the TV Tuner. Two weeks typing <em>Beep 1,2</em> to make sure it wasn&rsquo;t broken.</p>

<p>For most parts, check the list of <a href="http://elinux.org/RPi_VerifiedPeripherals">verified compatible devices here</a>. This is what you need:
<ol>
    <li><strong>The Raspberry Pi itself</strong>
<ol>
    <li>You can get it <a href="http://downloads.element14.com/raspberryPi1.html?isRedirect=true">online</a> from Farnell Element 14. Also most of <a href="http://ie.farnell.com/raspberry-pi-accessories">the accessories</a> I mention below. They are quoting a 3 week delivery time so get your skates on.</li>
    <li>And available online from <a href="http://raspberrypi.rsdelivers.com/default.aspx?cl=1">RS Components</a>. They have lots of accessories too.</li>
    <li>Orrrrr, you can skip everything I have written below and just get the<a href="http://www.maplin.co.uk/raspberry-piandreg-board-and-starter-kit-652805">Maplin Starter Kit</a>for Raspberry Pi. Unusually for them, it&rsquo;s actually decent value and you know all of the components have been tested for compatibility. There weren&rsquo;t any in Blackpool in Cork the last time I was there so ring-ahead or order online.</li>
</ol>
</li>
    <li><strong>An SD Card</strong>
<ol>
    <li>I got these <a href="http://www.7dayshop.com/7dayshop-professional-high-speed-sdhc-memory-card-16gb-class-10?cat=17&amp;cl=573">very cheap 16GB ones</a> from 7DayShop in Jersey but the casing on one has shattered after very little use. They have branded ones which should have better quality plastic.</li>
    <li>Micro-SD cards in an adapter work fine too.</li>
    <li>Get the fastest one you can. Class 10 for full SD works great as does Class 6 on MicroSD.</li>
    <li>Any size from 4GB up should be fine initially.</li>
</ol>
</li>
    <li><strong>A Micro-USB phone charger</strong>
<ol>
    <li>I&rsquo;m currently using the one from my HTC Sensation.</li>
    <li>Anything above 700mA should be fine but that excludes most cheap 500mA chargers that come with Chinese electronics.</li>
    <li>I&rsquo;ve had success with a some of the cheap ones from DX.com in China but many of the so-called 2 Amp ones can barely do 1 Amp so it might be best to avoid. Also, be warned, delivery times from DX can range from a week to many months.</li>
    <li>I was very surprised to see an entire shelf of power supplies in a small Maplin in London but not one Micro-USB charger. As a place where a lot of people go to get emergencyreplacementsfor things, they should surely have tons of these?</li>
</ol>
</li>
    <li><strong>TV Cables</strong>
<ol>
    <li>If the person you are buying for has an LCD/Plasma TV then any HDMI cable will be fine. I have used ones from DX and Lidl with no problems.</li>
    <li>If they have a older CRT TV then they will need a video cable with RCA at both ends and an audio cable with 3.5&rdquo; headphone jack at one end and RCA at the other end. If the TV takes RCA then that&rsquo;s all they need.</li>
    <li>If the TV only takes SCART, then you need an RCA to SCART adapter. Most TV shops have these. Maplin definitely do.</li>
    <li>If they have a monitor with DVI then there are HDMI-DVI adapters. Neither of theadapterson DX worked for me. See this page <a href="http://elinux.org/RPi_VerifiedPeripherals#Powered_USB_Hubs">for a list of compatible adapters</a>.</li>
    <li>If they have a monitor with VGA then this adapter on <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/BK-HDMI-Male-VGA-RGB-Female-HDMI-VGA-Video-Converter-adapter-1080P-PC-/140890052589?_trksid=p2047675.m1850&amp;_trkparms=aid%3D222002%26algo%3DSIC.FIT%26ao%3D1%26asc%3D11%26meid%3D3728751576962345077%26pid%3D100011%26prg%3D1005%26rk%3D1%26sd%3D130699741793%26">eBay</a> <em>may</em> work. Note that it works for me on two monitors here but totally failed on a projector at an event during the summer.</li>
</ol>
</li>
    <li><strong>USB Keyboard and Mouse</strong>
<ol>
    <li>I haven&rsquo;t found a wireless one which doesn&rsquo;t work. Lidl and Aldi both great for these at the right time of the year. Otherwise anywhere online or PC World.</li>
    <li>Not all wired keyboards will work as they may draw too much current. I have one roll-up rubber one (don&rsquo;t ask) which shuts the RPi down when I connect it.</li>
    <li>I found a dirt-cheap Microsoft wired Keyboard/Mouse for about 15 last year in Dixons</li>
</ol>
</li>
    <li><strong>Powered USB Hub</strong>
<ol>
    <li>USB remains a very frustrating experience on the Raspberry Pi. Unlike a PC, it seems to be a crap-shoot as to whether something will work on it or not. The problem is the tiny amount of power the two USB ports can provide (150mA compared to 500mA on most PCs) and some ongoing problems in the drivers.</li>
    <li>The best way to avoid this is to get a USB hub that can be externally powered and connect all devices to that. Unfortunately, many of the dirt cheap ones out there that have a power connector don&rsquo;t actually work with power connected.</li>
    <li><a href="http://dx.com/p/4-port-usb-2-0-hub-7980">This extremely cheap hub</a>($5!) that I got on DX last week seems to be working really well so far. It doesn&rsquo;t come with a power supply but accepts one. You&rsquo;ll have to find a 5V one yourself with that smaller size of power jack.</li>
    <li>To be absolutely sure, just check <a href="http://elinux.org/RPi_VerifiedPeripherals#Powered_USB_Hubs">this list of compatible hubs</a>.</li>
    <li>If you continue to have problems then you may be forced (as I was) to hack the USB cable from the hub to the RPi and disconnect the power lines so that the Hub isn&rsquo;t sending power back up to the RPi</li>
</ol>
</li>
    <li><strong>Wireless Adapter</strong>
<ol>
    <li>Whilst the RPi has an Ethernet port, it&rsquo;s not really that useful for many people whose broadband routers are in the hall. One of our RPis is wired but that&rsquo;s because we run GigE cabling everywhere.</li>
    <li>I have a ton of Wifi adapters collected over the years. Most of them work on the RPi.</li>
    <li>I&rsquo;m currently using some random Wireless-G one to stream a webcam internally.</li>
    <li>Again, check <a href="http://elinux.org/RPi_VerifiedPeripherals#USB_WiFi_Adapters">the list of compatible ones</a> here</li>
    <li>And again, connect it using the hub to avoid power problems</li>
    <li>The current version of Raspbian for Raspberry Pi comes with a nice Wifi GUI config tool to make setup very easy indeed.</li>
</ol>
</li>
    <li><strong>The Raspberry Pi User Guide</strong>
<ol>
    <li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Raspberry-User-Guide-Eben-Upton/dp/111846446X/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1353918867&amp;sr=8-5">Get it here</a> on Amazon</li>
    <li>Because I still have my ZX Spectrum manual and still remember drawing my first circle on the screen using the instructions in it.</li>
</ol>
</li>
    <li><strong>A nice case</strong>
<ol>
    <li>If you are feeling very generous.</li>
    <li>Some lovely ones on the <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/category/105">Adafruit site</a> in New York</li>

                        <p>#&ldquo;My 4 years of Android today and Ireland&rsquo;s first Android App&rdquo;</p>

<p>Today is the 4th anniversary of me paying $499 on eBay for a HTC G1, the first Android phone. Whilst some of my tech predictions over the years have been a little off (<em>cough</em> iPad) I couldn&rsquo;t have got it more right with Android.</p>

<p>When I heard about the Android project mid-2008, it was obvious Google wasn&rsquo;t going into things half-heartedly. The G1 itself was a mixed bag. Ugly as sin but with a slide-out keyboard that I still love. Android 1.5 was rough but very functional for someone like me who spends their time on Google products like GMail. I still have the G1, running Android 2.3 and waking me up every morning.</p>

<p>The reason I got the G1 was not for pointless bragging rights, it was because we had decided to build an Android App to show-off the <a href="http://www.loudervoice.com/products/enterprise-reviews/">LouderVoice</a> API to some Enterprise customers we were trying to land in the mobile space.</p>

<p>I created the spec and wireframes for the App and also figured out what extra features our API would need. The basic idea was &ldquo;Review Anything Anywhere&rdquo;. Essentially what Kevin Rose tried to do with Oink several years later. We both failed because no-one wants to do that :-)</p>

<p>Marino Software in Dublin did the App coding for us and we finally launched <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.marinosoftware.loudervoice&amp;feature=search_result">Ireland&rsquo;s first Android App</a> in May 2009 for Android 1.6. It never had many users but it was a fantastic tool for showing potential business customers what our system could do.</p>

<p>The same back-end API is now used to power the reviews in the Riverdance Android and iPhone Apps.</p>

<p>Last week I installed the old App again on my HTC Sensation running Android 4.1.2 and whaddyaknow, it still works! Sure the graphics-scaling is horrific on that big screen but you can still browse and submit reviews to our API.</p>

<p>In those 4 years I&rsquo;ve gone through a HTC G1, HTC Desire and HTC Sensation. I&rsquo;ve also bought a ZTE Blade and Eken T02 tablet for others. There is no doubt that my next phone will be Android but sadly not HTC, as I insist on my phones having replaceable battery and SD card. At some point next year I&rsquo;ll get a decent Android Tablet too.</p>

<p>There are two upcoming areas I find exciting in the world of Android:
<ol>
    <li><strong>Ultra-cheap single board Android computers in the style of Raspberry Pi</strong>. Most of these are being sold as <a href="http://dx.com/s/android.html?category=191">1080p media players</a> but <a href="http://apc.io/">they can do a hell of a lot more</a> for very little money. Which feeds into point 2.</li>
    <li><strong>Hardware interfaces like IOIO</strong>. Once I finish a couple of my fun Raspberry Pi and Arduino projects, I want to do some car projects using <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10748">IOIO</a>. Rather than your phone/tablet just being for calls/music/GPS in the car, imagine if it was connected to a wide range of sensors and interfaces. Every car on the road acting as a generator of a wide range of interesting IoT data, all location-tagged and uploaded live over a mobile data connection.</li>
</ol>
We&rsquo;ve come a long way baby.</p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;Sib\u00e9al&rsquo;s Halloween Eye of Deatttttttttth&rdquo;</p>

<p>Myself and Sibal put together a really simple but effective spooky eye for Halloween recently. It caused great interest in her school during Halloween dress-up day just before mid-term.</p>

<p>It simply consists of an old ping-pong ball with a hole dremeled into it and large bright red LED inserted into the hole. That&rsquo;s connected via a resistor and long wires down her arm to her wrist which has a PP9 battery taped to it. That leads to an on-off switch in her hand so she can catch people unaware.</p>

<p><a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Workspace-1_006.png"><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Workspace-1_006.png" alt="" title="Workspace 1_006" width="876" height="653" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-896" /></a></p>

<p>It is genuinely scary in the dark and the bright LED created freaky concentric circles which were missing when we used a smaller duller LED.</p>

<p>httpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3XGo6rl_tc</p>

<p>The main things it made us think of were Terminator, the Daleks and Davros.</p>

<p>Time to start planning next Halloween.</p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;The @RaspberryPi Doorbell of Dooooooooommmmmmmm&rdquo;</p>

<p>We had some good fun last night with the neighbourhood kids making use of ourDoorbell of Dooooooooommmmmmmm.</p>

<p><img class="alignnone" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Dwcpjbp-xsk/UJJ1_hkQBhI/AAAAAAAAjQs/elUv6hKPHfI/s800/IMG_20121031_162253.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="800" /></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had a bigger doorbell project planned for quite a while but 2 weeks ago decided we should do a simpler Halloween one. Using various bits bought from Sparkfun and Maplin along with <a href="http://learn.adafruit.com/playing-sounds-and-using-buttons-with-raspberry-pi">a great tutorial from Adafruit</a> (more below), I finally got something we were happy with, working late last week. Then yesterday evening I put it in place on the door. Unfortunately, with all the pulling, taping and general movement, one of the five buttons stopped working. But the other 4 were fine.</p>

<p><img class="alignnone" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-X97KKH4-a-Q/UJJ2EtigEnI/AAAAAAAAjQ0/g9hVVb7geOo/s800/IMG_20121031_162245.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600" /></p>

<p>The sounds used were pulled from various online sources. Sibal came up with the Mr Burns idea and Oisn thought of the Home Alone one. I used Audacity to clip some of them and ffmpeg to convert some of the YouTube videos to audio. The cheques are in the post :-)</p>

<p>Originally I was going to use Arduino for this but considering a Waveshield for playing audio costs more than a Raspberry Pi, I changed direction. I then thought I&rsquo;d use the Arduino for the button detection andcommunicateover USB to the RPi but I finally realised I should just use the GPIO pins directly on the RPi itself. My worry about killing it accidentally were unfounded.</p>

<p><img class="alignnone" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-9myanqq6Ods/UJJ2Lf_TDjI/AAAAAAAAjRE/H-o0MiUDh04/s800/IMG_20121031_162214.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600" /></p>

<p>The first version was done on a breadboard to make sure I made no mistakes. It worked well. But it was never going to work stuck to a doorframe so I moved to a strip of veroboard and soldered it together. This had a few, ahem, glitches, which took a while to sort out due to my soldering incompetence.</p>

<p><img class="alignnone" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Vu64htXLUPQ/UJJ2StT1LtI/AAAAAAAAjRU/30aCSiV3KZk/s800/IMG_20121026_155921.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="800" /></p>

<p>The final setup was really simple:
<ol>
    <li>One button per sound</li>
    <li>Each button connected to a GPIO pin on the RPi along with connection to 3.3V and GND on the RPi (pull up resistors there too but apparently not necessary?)</li>
    <li>An old 40-core IDE cable from a dead PC used to safely connect the wires from the buttons to the pins on the RPi.</li>
    <li>Extremely simple Python code running in a loop on the RPi which checked to see if any of the connected pins were pulled low by the button being pressed.</li>
    <li>If so, it made an external call to mplayer to play one of our selected audio clips</li>
</ol>
<img class="alignnone" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-rAmfSFYFwwI/UJJ2Pff5PdI/AAAAAAAAjRM/98cJyIoqW5o/s800/IMG_20121031_162206.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600" /></p>

<p>The only real change from the <a href="http://learn.adafruit.com/playing-sounds-and-using-buttons-with-raspberry-pi">Adafruit tutorial</a> was to use mplayer instead of mpg123. This allowed me to use any audio format including WAV, rather than just MP3s. Also some of the instructions are a little redundant with the latest version of Debian on RPi, but they do no harm.</p>

<p>This is the trivial script to set the volume and call the Python script:</p>

<p>This diagram of the RPi pin-out was invaluable:</p>

<p><a href="http://elinux.org/RPi_Low-level_peripherals#Referring_to_pins_on_the_Expansion_header"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-894" title="GPIOs" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/GPIOs.png" alt="" width="254" height="581" /></a></p>

<p>Once everything was setup at the door yesterday, we then found that the volume on the Lidl iPod Dock was far too low. I had to put a tiny battery powered speaker outside, taped to the postbox. But even that wasn&rsquo;t great so I added a Fiio amplifier. Of course then we couldn&rsquo;t hear it inside, so I split the audio and used one audio device inside and one outside.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t have time to setup wireless on the RPi so I used a wired network connection. This enabled me to SSH to the RPi from my PC and start the Python program. It also allowed me to remotely change the Home Alone clip to the howl from An American Werewolf in London after it got a bit tiresome, 2 hours later.</p>

<p>I made a video of it all in action but the bloody version of CM10 on my phone corrupted it. To give you a taste of what it was like, I extracted the audio from it. Enjoy:</p>

<p>Changes? Instead of externally calling mplayer, it&rsquo;d be better to use some sort of audio library that would allow a follow-on button-press to interrupt whatever is playing. Also, approx 75% of kids pressed the top button so the next time we&rsquo;ll randomise what is played.</p>

<p>Next steps? Well that&rsquo;d be our Social-Enabled Doorbell. It&rsquo;ll probably be Christmas before I finish it tho.</p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;Open Data Ireland&rsquo;s first meetup tonight in Engine Yard&rdquo;</p>

<p>Great to see this <a href="http://meetup.opendata.ie/">Meetup</a> happen and big props to Eamon and the crew for hosting.If you are interested in getting involved in OpenData in Ireland please attend. <a href="http://meetup.opendata.ie/">Registration is here</a> but the event is free.</p>

<p>Ireland needs to get beyond talking about OpenData and start increasing the number of people actually <em><strong>Opening Up The Data</strong></em> in a big way. The Irish tech community has to lead by example and that means just doing it.</p>

<p>(Apologies to <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/">Code For America</a> for the visual knock-off)</p>

<p>There is so much data out there that anyone with even a modicum of technical ability could unleash. The most complicated thing I had to do in geo-coding the Property Price Register was to merge two columns in Excel!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m hopefully (the Eircom DSL gods permitting) going to give a short talk remotely from Bandon, long known as &ldquo;The Silicon Valley on the N71&rdquo; :-) I&rsquo;ve a few bits n bobs to describe, some thoughts to share and some ideas I hope others can run with.</p>

<p>Ideally we&rsquo;ll do the whole thing as a Google+ Live Hangout so anyone can connect in. <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/1/events/cucdbuf9rfs1c5qu6ldapj1f1f4">Sign up for the Hangout here</a>. I&rsquo;ll post the Live URL if we have success with it. If that falls apart then I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;ll just be point-to-point Skype.</p>
