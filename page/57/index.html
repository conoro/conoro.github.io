                        <p>#&ldquo;Some HTC Desire Problems&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;ve had the Desire for a while now and generally I&rsquo;m a huge fan. Best phone I&rsquo;ve ever owned. But there are some big glitches which drive me mad and a lot of them arerelatedto the RF bits.</p>
<p>In noparticularorder:</p>
<ul>
<li>Loses ability to connect to known+remembered Wifi access points and I have to disable/re-enable Wifi to get it to work. Particularly annoying when you were relying on it to download the lastest podcasts overnight and it couldn&rsquo;t.</li>
<li>Loses ability to communicate over mobile data if it has spent a long time going in and out of poor signal area. Reboot needed.</li>
<li>Wifi interferes with A2DP Bluetooth audio streaming to my car stereo (audio cuts out for 1 second every 10 seconds). Must be disabled. Yes I could use an audio cable but if I am alsochargingthe phone, the electrical noise of the car comes out through the stereo.</li>
<li>Speaking of which, are there car cigarette lighter noise filters?</li>
<li>Actual RF performance not as good as any Nokia. Have to re-send SMS multiple times in location where Nokia will squeeze it out.</li>
<li>All of the above problems were in the old G1 as well so it&rsquo;s a systematic problem with HTC</li>
<li>If I am playing a podcast it will often signal an inbound call by randomly playing a song on the phone. This is one of the most confusing things to ever happen to me, particularly since I was driving and also because it didn&rsquo;t pause the podcast!</li>
<li>Crashes fairly regularly if I use a lot of Wifi/3G/Bluetooth over a few days</li>
<li>Trashed my SDCard and I had to reformat it</li>
<li>None of that last three happened with the Cyanogen community firmware on the G1</li>
<li>The phone is totally locked down unlike its almost perfect clone, the Nexus One. So it is proving very difficult for it to be rooted so that community firmware can be used on it. Why do you care HTC? Particularly since Google makes it easy on the Nexus One. Would you not like some great community patches to become part of your offering?</li>
<li>The camera is pretty shite. Fine for static stuff but don&rsquo;t dare move. Not a patch on the old N95-8GB</li>
<li>Battery life is hilariously bad. I could see the battery level race to zero in realtime as I streamed a podcast over 3G and listened to it with A2DP headphones. An extreme example I know but the phone became almost too hot to handle! Luckily, unlike the iPhone, you can replace the battery so I have 3.</li>
<li>The back cover isdefinitelygoing to become loose with the number of times I have to take it off to replace the battery.</li>
<li>GPS went completely mental today. Decided I was in Banteer when I was actually 150 miles away in Dublin. And this was with it claiming full GPS lock. Needless to say, the otherwise excellent Navigation was pretty useless today.</li>
<li>Why do I need to press a physical button and then swipe the screen to unlock it every bloody time?</li>
<li>The answer-call/ignore-call swipe thing is idiotic. Red and Green screen buttons please.</li>
</ul>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the bad stuff. Plenty of good stuff coming tomorrow or Friday.</p>
<p></p></p>

 <blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">If the government wants to help innovation in this country they should get busy with infrastructure. Lay fiber to every home and business in the U.S. Actually start building some of these high speed train networks to make travel easier. Get computers into the hands of every child in the country as soon as they are physically able to press buttons. Heck, put a woman on the moon.

 <p>Wonderful piece by Mike. The paragraph above is the most important and applies 100x in Ireland.
</p><p>I know Mike is moving to Seattle but I'm sure we could get him to holiday in Cork and be Ireland's part-time CTO?
</p><p>In contrast with the Valley, given the dire state of venture funding in Ireland, some State intervention has been required. 
</p><p>I'm pleased to see that some of the activities by Enterprise Ireland in the funding space over the past 2 years are starting to work. Kernel Capital is finally executing well on its seed fund now that a minimum deal flow has been mandated. I hope to see the same from Enterprise Equity. I also believe a new non-seed-fund has just closed.
</p><p>Des Doyle gave a great opening talk at a session in Enterprise Ireland last week. He was scathing about Irish banks and how they have de-skilled over the past ten years. If senior people in State Bodies are taking off the gloves and calling it like it is, then there is hope for us yet.
</p><p>So Minister Eamonn Ryan, stop playing with little dinky electric milk floats and put your efforts where it can have a material effect on the lives of more than just South Dublin middle-class commuters in their Priuses. 
</p><p>The Minister, along with Batt O'Keeffe and the Taoiseach should put a call into Mike. Then follow that with a call to Irishman Tim O'Reilly so he can explain what Government 2.0 is.</p></div>

<p>I just got my new ATM card in the post from Ulster Bank and it&#39;s no longer a Laser Card, it&#39;s Visa Debit. They claim it is accepted in more places globally. This seems reasonable since I have never seen Laser as an online payment method outside of Ireland. <p /><div>One trick a lot of people have been using (the guys in <a href="http://www.curiouswines.ie/">Curious Wines</a> told me about it) when buying Ryanair tickets is to use an <a href="http://www.entropay.com/">Entropay</a> Virtual Debit Card. Ryanair doesn&#39;t charge a fee if you use a debit card but they won&#39;t accept Visa. Entropay only made sense if you had managed to get a sub-10 ticket since their own fees would then exceed those of Ryanair.</div> <p /><div>So the question is, can we now use the Ulster Bank Visa Debit on Ryanair and avoid their card fees?</div><p /><div>Damn, maybe not, the Ryanair site is saying the zero-fee thing is for Mastercard only and for a &quot;limited time only&quot;.</div></p>

<p><p>Oooh, I just noticed a change in the Android Marketplace. With my Vodafone Ireland SIM, I can now upgrade paid apps that I bought on my 3 UK SIM.</p>
<p>I also spotted a tweet earlier that Google Checkout now works here too.</p>
<p>Still can&rsquo;t buy apps but I&rsquo;m guessing we are very close.</p>
<p>Wahoo!</p></p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;AdBlock on Chrome enabling insertion of invisible spam into Zoho CRM e-mail signatures&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I emailed a potential client yesterday who replied that she couldn&rsquo;t read my email as it had crashed her email client. She also said that the email was huge.I had sent the email using Zoho CRM and when I checked it, it looked fine. Only a few lines long.So I sent myself a test message which also looked fine.</p>
<p>Then I did view-source on the message. Holy Crap. Hundreds of lines of HTML with ads inserted all over it. Now wonder her email crashed.</p>
<p>The bit that had me really worried was the I sent it from an Ubuntu machine which &ldquo;shouldn&rsquo;t&rdquo; suffer from such exploits.</p>
<p>I went into Zoho and couldn&rsquo;t see where it could have happened. Then I had the aha moment (no, not Morten) and checked my Signature setting. Damn it looked fine. Wait, try view-source again. All the bastard HTML there in all it&rsquo;s glory.</p>
<p>I was able to reliably replicate the problem. Paste text signature in Zoho field, save, re-open, view-source, see spam.</p>
<p>I then tried it on Firefox. It didn&rsquo;t have the problem. Weird.</p>
<p>Then Windows 7. Chrome - bad. Firefox - good. And in a shocker, IE8 - good.</p>
<p>WTF?</p>
<p>So I went over to a netbook which I booted up with a clean Ubuntu USB stick and installed Chrome. And all was well, no problem. WTF x2?</p>
<p>OK, so what is common amongst two machines but not a third, despite operating system differences? Aha, the browser extensions. Luckily I only have 3 installed so it was easy to test.</p>
<p>First I uninstalled AdBlock which I run mainly to block Flash ads since they cripple the CPU on netbooks and Ubuntu boxes.</p>
<p>Job done! Problem gone.</p>
<p>This is very very <strong>very</strong> serious. Something you install to block ads ends up causing the mailing of spam ads to your customers. Very very serious indeed.</p>
<p>I have reported it to Zoho in case they can block the problem at their end and ditto to the AdBlock people since it is more likely to be an exploit of them rather than dodgy behaviour. Here is a screen shot of some of what it was inserting:</p>
