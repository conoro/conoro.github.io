                        <p>I have long bemoaned Lego&rsquo;s approach to adding electronics/power to their kits. Technics seems to be its own little sub-section and Mindstorms is a crazy waste of money in an Arduino and Raspberry Pi world. Now that they are the biggest toy company globally, I&rsquo;d love to see how either of those product ranges are adding to the bottom line.</p>

<p>In that spirit I was very excited about the possibilities of the Lego Batman kit I got in Hamley&rsquo;s recently. After beating back the sales people who tried to sell me blue or white Batmen (are they completely insane?), I finally found a proper black one from the movie.</p>

</p>

<p>On Saturday, I started assembly with my two daughters and a small bit of help/interest from one of the boys. When I say &ldquo;I started assembly&rdquo;, I really mean I handed the pieces to the girls who then clicked them into place with zero delay and almost no reference to the instructions. Their spatial reasoning seems to be at 1000x the speed of mine.</p>

<p>We were thrilled with the result but I have bigger plans for this helicopter. Phase one was the motor for the rotor. I have a bunch of a rumble motors from broken original XBOX controllers and it was a trivial task to hotglue on a piece of metal to connect it to the rotor.</p>

<p>I tried to zip tie the motor to the helicopter but then the general solution dawned on me: I should be hotgluing these add-ons to pieces of lego and then it becomes a simple exercise to add/remove them from kits, depending on the mood you are in.</p>

<p>This worked like a charm and all of the kids were suitably impressed. Here it is in action. Watch those fingers!</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll switch to a LiPo battery and smaller switch and wiring later in the week. The kids have also suggested the next set of improvements which we&rsquo;ll do next weekend. Yes of course it involves LEDs.</p>

                    <div class="post-description">
                        <p>Back in 2011, I <a href="http://conoroneill.com/2011/11/17/bandon-flood-fews-open-data-now-available/">created a simple scraper</a> in Python to take the river level reported by the Bandon Flood Early Warning System every 15 minutes and save it in <a href="https://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?docid=103YIcARoxuaWT7NfZ8mVBzY554sF_3ONYC1N3DE">Google Fusion Tables</a>. In 2012, <a href="http://conoroneill.net/bandon-flood-data-fews-now-available-on-cosmpachube/">I extended it</a> to also save the data on <a href="https://xively.com/feeds/40004/?from_cosm=true">Pachube/Cosm/Xively/Fleeglrheumazoid</a> (or whatever insane name they have this week). So you have 2.5 years of river data in tabular and graphic form.</p>

<p>The code itself is very simple and just involved walking through the page (actually a bloody iframe!) to get the element I needed. But it&rsquo;s brittle, single use and runs on a home server behind the firewall. I also have a gap in the data in 2012 where I didn&rsquo;t notice that the cronjob had screwed up for 2 weeks.</p>

<p>Last week I heard about <a href="https://www.kimonolabs.com/">Kimono</a> and really liked the sound of it. You basically point it at any web-page and it gives you a version of the page where you can select elements and get API end-points for them. So any site that has info you&rsquo;d like to use or open up but where there is no existing API, can be API-ified. You need no coding knowledge to do this.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/kimono.jpg" alt="Kimono" title="Web Scraping" />
</p>

<p>This has huge potential to generate even more Irish OpenData without relying on developers to do the work. Given how little data has been opened up here, either officially or by OpenData enthusiasts, this can only be a good thing.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;d like to access the Bandon River level programatically now, <a href="https://www.kimonolabs.com/apis/cr79egwi">it is here as JSON, CSV and RSS</a>.</p>

<p>As an exercise for the reader, why not try the truly hilarious <a href="http://maps.corkcoco.ie/planningenquiryv3/LAResources/info.aspx">Cork County Council Planning Enquiry System</a> which works best with Internet Explorer 5.5 or newer :-) Of course, the &ldquo;accept terms and conditions button&rdquo; does not work with Chrome. It looks like the same web gurus who designed Bandon FEWS also did this site, since both use 1990s-style frames, which Kimono does not handle at all. I just spent 2 mins playing with it and picked out the <a href="http://maps.corkcoco.ie/planningenquiryv3/enquiry.aspx">central frame</a>. But Kimono-ifying it gives a session timeout error by the CorkCoCo site. I think a small bit of effort could get this working. Any takers or do you all prefer to just talk about OpenData?</p>

                        <p>One small annoyance with the Baseline bolierplate in harp.js is that every blogpost needs to be listed in a file called _data.json with all the relevant metadata. Whilst it&rsquo;s not a huge job to slug-ify a title and add the ID and epoch time, it&rsquo;s sufficiently annoying to add friction to me blogging more. Here&rsquo;s the entry for this blogpost:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">
  &quot;a-simple-nodejs-script-to-setup-a-new-blog-post-in-harpjs&quot;: {
    &quot;ID&quot;: 1291,
    &quot;author&quot;: &quot;admin&quot;,
    &quot;date&quot;: 1403504847928,
    &quot;ptype&quot;: &quot;post&quot;,
    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;This little script generates the relevant metadata in the _data.json file including epoch time and optional Facebook thumbnail URL if you are using the Baseline boilerplate.&quot;,
    &quot;slug&quot;: &quot;a-simple-nodejs-script-to-setup-a-new-blog-post-in-harpjs&quot;,
    &quot;status&quot;: &quot;publish&quot;,

    &quot;FBImage&quot;: &quot;https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/newpost.jpg&quot;
  }

</code></pre>

<p>This little script just generates everything you need once you tell it a title, description and image &ldquo;thumbnail&rdquo;. That latter piece is something I added to the _data.json &ldquo;schema&rdquo; so that when my posts are auto-shared to Facebook by dlvr.it, it&rsquo;s not the same image there every time but one of my chosing.</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">

<p>Sourcecode <a href="https://github.com/conoro/conoro.github.io/blob/master/_harp/js/newpost.js">is on GitHub</a> as always.</p>

<p>One interesting side-note was how much effort it was to find a Node module that asks for user input in the way I needed. There are lots of modules out there for Q&amp;A and some of them make it very easy to ask lots of questions, but not one of them (not one!) is able to deal with input that stretches over more than the terminal width. All of them start overwriting what you write on the screen instead of scrolling up. That&rsquo;s a pretty staggering oversight by a lot of developers. Eventually I found the classic readline library which I have used in many languages over the years and it worked like a charm.</p>

                        <p>Whilst there are tons of tools to do S3 upload, I wanted something tuned to how I blog, particularly with a static blog that used to be a WordPress one with year/month directories for images.</p>

<p>Usage:
<code>bash
node upload_s3_images.js image1.jpg image2.jpg image3.png etc
</code></p>

<p>It uses your AWS credentials in ~/aws_config.json { &ldquo;accessKeyId&rdquo;: &ldquo;akid&rdquo;, &ldquo;secretAccessKey&rdquo;: &ldquo;secret&rdquo;, &ldquo;region&rdquo;: &ldquo;us-west-2&rdquo; }</p>

<p>It uses the bucket name and root upload directory from ./s3_blog_config.json {&ldquo;bucket&rdquo;: &ldquo;conoroneill.net&rdquo;, &ldquo;rootUploadDir&rdquo;: &ldquo;wp-content/uploads/&rdquo;}</p>

<p>So if I have a file called s3_upload.jpg on my Desktop and I invoke as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">node upload_s3_images.js ~/Desktop/s3_upload.jpg
</code></pre>

<p>I end up with a file at: <a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/s3_upload.jpg">https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/s3_upload.jpg</a></p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">// upload_s3_images.js
// Upload a space separated list of images to an S3 bucket for use by your Harp.js static blog
// node upload_s3_images.js image1.jpg image2.jpg image3.png etc
// Uses your AWS credentials in ~/aws_config.json { &quot;accessKeyId&quot;: &quot;akid&quot;, &quot;secretAccessKey&quot;: &quot;secret&quot;, &quot;region&quot;: &quot;us-west-2&quot; }
// Uses bucket name and root upload directory from ./s3_blog_config.json {&quot;bucket&quot;: &quot;conoroneill.net&quot;, &quot;rootUploadDir&quot;: &quot;wp-content/uploads/&quot;}
// My blog is exported from WordPress so it uses /wp-content/uploads/year/month/ as the directory stucture

                        <p>After 7 long years, Twitter finally added people muting recently. Meanwhile those of us who never use the official apps and use Janetter etc instead have had powerful keyword filtering for years. I see Twitter has some silly &ldquo;which team do you support in the World Cup&rdquo; nonsense now. But they really aren&rsquo;t thinking this through. There are many many many many people on Twitter who would happily never see a World Cup tweet. Why not make that happen as an opt-in but instead of just hiding them, replace each World Cup tweet with an Ad for something non-sport-related (in third party clients too). Finally a sustainable business model for Twitter. For the summer at least :-) You&rsquo;re welcome Twitter.</p>

                        <p>One thing I&rsquo;ve run into many times is the lack of internet bandwidth at events. It doesn&rsquo;t seem to matter whether it is a big pay-for thing or a BarCamp - once everyone was online, things slowed to a crawl. This was a really big problem at Dojo Camp last year where we had to get a ton of kids setup with the Arduino IDE and other tools. In the end it was faster to pass around a USB key but we lost a lot of valuable time doing this.</p>

<p><a href="http://piratebox.de/">PirateBox</a> has been around for ages as an anonymous drop box (not DropBox!). Basically it&rsquo;s software and configuration using dirt cheap TP-Link routers to provide a wifi access point with connected storage and files. Version 1.0 was just released which is a ground-up rebuild.</p>

<p>So at events you could tell everyone to connect to one or more of these PirateBoxes, where you and the various presenters/talkers have pre-uploaded all of the relevant material and assets, so they can be quickly accessed and downloaded.</p>

<p>In addition to file sharing, it also has chatting, message boarding, and media streaming. I&rsquo;d love to check out how many people it can support simultaneously.</p>

<p>As a <a href="http://piratebox.de/openwrt:diy">$35 self-build exercise</a>, it seems like a no-brainer.</p>
