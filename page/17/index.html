<p>Tomorrow we&rsquo;re doing more digging into Arduino with her, Oscar and maybe Oisn. First, the treadmill :-)</p>

<p>As part of the kids and I playing around with Arduino, Sibal thought that we should try and find an alarm clock project for her to build. I&rsquo;ve found some amazing ones with features like Vacuum Flourescent Tubes but they are a very pricey and the mechanical learning ones on Amazon don&rsquo;t really keep time</p>

<p>Then today I found this, <a href="http://www.jamiemcmahondesign.com/the-acoustic-alarm">The Acoustic Alarm</a>. I have no idea how the designer made it but it&rsquo;s just beautiful. I think we would just need to add a real-time clock to our basic Arduino kit with the servo to do the movement piece. Then Sibal could throw her 8 y/o artistic brain at doing the physical casing etc. If we make any progress I&rsquo;ll let you know.</p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;Two tutorials later and the kids are liking the Arduino a lot&rdquo;</p>

<p>I sat down with 8 y/o daughter and 10 y/o son this afternoon to try out our <a href="http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/ardx-the-starter-kit-for-arduino-p-1153.html?cPath=138">ARDX starter kit</a> for <a href="http://arduino.cc/">Arduino</a>. The first tutorial is a simple single LED which you flash on/off in software. But I was horrified to find myself stumped!</p>

<p><a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/ardx01.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-756" title="ardx01" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/ardx01.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600" /></a></p>

<p>Yes, I may have a Masters in Electronic Engineering from UCD but, as anyone who did Electronics there prior to the mid-90s knows, a certain lecturer ensured that we all left completely clueless in basic circuit cop-on.</p>

<p>The ARDX kit on the surface has a lovely introductory booklet but it really misses the mark on practical instructions. So they tell you what every component does which is good but nowhere does it explain how the holes in a breadboard are connected. Are they long columns of commonality or short rows? Do the power lines go from top to bottom or only in small blocks? Kind of important information!</p>

<p>Add to that a completely indecipheral diagram for where the components should go plus several connections which were totally unnecessary and I ended up totally flustered with the two kids getting bored.</p>

<p>Finally I threw away the instructions, thought about it for a second and realised it was dead easy. Some trial/error figured out the breadboard layout and hurrah, a blinking LED! We played a bit with on/off timings and we were immediately ready for more.</p>

<p>This time we did 8 LEDs which worked right first time and we loved the default on/off pattern. One thing we realised was that a magnifying glass is a big help when trying to see the individual breadboard holes.</p>

<p><a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/ardx02.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-757" title="ardx02" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/ardx02.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600" /></a></p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s as far as we got. They both want to try some more interesting LED patterns and then move on to the motors, servos and sensors. The long term plan is to build something &ldquo;robotic&rdquo;.</p>

<p>More on that next weekend.</p>

<p>Then of course I found this site called <a href="http://diydrones.com/">DIYDrones</a> about UAVs&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>

<p>This simple Tweetdeck filter is doing a pretty decent job so far. No need for dilithium crystals. I&rsquo;ll tweak it as the volume increases over the next few days. But at this stage I don&rsquo;t even know if the thing has started yet or not.</p>

<p>If I had any interest I&rsquo;d probably look up what coybig means. Is it pornographic?

                        <p>#&ldquo;Learn electronics with an Arduino and @Raspberry_Pi on an old Philips TV&rdquo;</p>

<p>Been slammed with work for two weeks (will never complain about that!) which means blogging has been a bit light. But the big excitement yesterday was my <a href="http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/ardx-the-starter-kit-for-arduino-p-1153.html?cPath=138">ARDX Arduino Starter Kit</a> arriving from Seeedstudio.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.seeedstudio.com"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-747" title="P4113660" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/P4113660.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="525" /></a></p>

<p>If you are not familair with <a href="http://arduino.cc">Arduino</a>, it is an OpenSource hardware platform forelectronicsprojects, tinkering, robotics, home automation etc etc etc. The blue board above is the heart of it.</p>

<p>The Starter Kit makes it possible for anyone, even with zero electronics knowledge to assemble simple circuits with no soldering and then run code on the Arduino microcontroller to do &ldquo;things&rdquo;. In this kit it ranges from blinking an LED to controlling a motor. Once you get the hang of it, a whole world of experimentation awaits you. There are also tons of add-on boards called Shields to do everything from advanced motor control to LCD and GPS.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t had a chance to try anything on the Arduino yet except run a simple program to flash the on-board LED.</p>

<p>But I was over the moon to discover that that <a href="http://www.raspbian.org/">Raspbian</a> distribution for <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> has a working copy of the Arduino IDE which is what you use to write your programs, upload them to the Arduino and run them. A few minutes later, I had everything working.</p>

<p><a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/rpiardx01.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-748" title="rpiardx01" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/rpiardx01.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600" /></a></p>

<p>Then for kicks and giggles I connected the RPi up to a 12 yo Philips portable telly. And it works too! Massive massive flashbacks to the ZX Spectrum days.</p>

<p><a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/rpiardx02.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-749" title="rpiardx02" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/rpiardx02.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600" /></a></p>

<p>This is more amazing than it first might seem. Think about it - A computer for $25 connected to an electronics learning kit for $79 connected to an old telly. Everything you need to becomecompetentwith both computers and electronics. And you don&rsquo;t even need the internet at home.</p>

<p><a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/rpiardx03.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-750" title="rpiardx03" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/rpiardx03.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600" /></a></p>

<p>Get a wifi dongle <a href="http://www.dealextreme.com/p/mini-usb-150mbps-802-11b-g-n-wifi-wireless-network-adapter-106094">for 6</a> and borrow a mobile phone charger. Then spend anhour a week in school or Coder Dojo or somewhere offering free Wifi (Mahon Point!) to grab any software updates you need and to download any webpages, manuals, example code etc. And you can do the rest at home.</p>

<p>Old school!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll do a video and proper post on the Arduuino kit once I&rsquo;ve assembled it and tried out a few of the projects over the weekend.</p>

<p>6 days ago, I posted this on Google+</p>

<p><a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/plusplaces.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-742" title="plusplaces" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/plusplaces.png" alt="" width="590" height="244" /></a></p>

<p>The response from a Googler was that &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have anything new to share right now&rdquo;. The following day, Scoble stated that he had heard they will announce a Write-API at Google IO.</p>

<p>Instead, they make the blindingly obvious step of <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/05/localnow-with-dash-of-zagat-and.html">merging Places with Google+ Pages</a> to make <a href="https://plus.google.com/local">Plus Local</a>. A totally sensible move.</p>

<p>Except,Zagat? Really? Youhonestlythink you can jam that down people&rsquo;s throats? How many attempts has that been now to beat Yelp and TripAdvisor? All of them flops.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve closely watched reviews on Places since they removed all Third Party content and,unsurprisingly, it&rsquo;s a graveyard, just like Google+. We know plenty of SEO people who try to cajole people into writing reviews on Places. Not because Places is any good but because Google highlights its own reviews in the SERPs over organic results and doesn&rsquo;t put them where they belong, in the ads section at the top. And lets be absolutely clear, that&rsquo;s what they are, Ads for Google.</p>

<p>The ever growing outcome of this is that people are losing trust in the search results. They are no longer the best results, they aredisguisedads.</p>

<p>So now we have the same trick all over again, this time on Google+. They are using the fear of not appearing well in the fiddled search results to get businesses to use Zagat reviews on Google+ instead of providing a PLATFORM for businesses.</p>

<p>I criticise Facebook relentlessly but this is one thing they have done 100% correctly and they have handed Google its ass on a plate. By providing rich APIs and a Platform where businesses can build whatever they want, you get real innovation. Facebook doesn&rsquo;t dictate. As long as you aren&rsquo;t doing anything nefarious, they <em>want</em> you to do what you like.</p>

<p>Google cannot overcome their centralised command and control mind-set. The thought of letting businesses and users do whatever they damn well please on a Google property fills them with dread. &ldquo;What do you mean you want to put your reviews on Google+? No no no, Zagat only.&rdquo; This is Google&rsquo;s fatal flaw. They don&rsquo;t trust anyone to have good judgement. They know best. Meanwhile Google+ remains a graveyard apart from the hardcore group of SEO people trying to figure out how they can game the search results.</p>

<p>Google, the only way to save Google+ is to turn it into a PLATFORM, not a destination. You have lots of very smart people working for you. But there are a lot more smart people out there who don&rsquo;t work for Google. They are the ones who&rsquo;ll come up with your next big leap forward, not you. Enable and facilitate those people instead of hawking some hackneyed old &ldquo;it&rsquo;s Google&rsquo;s way or the highway&rdquo; mentality.</p>

<p>If a full rich Platform with Write-API access is not announced at Google IO, you can expect to see the Google+ brand to disappear before the end of 2012.</p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;My 70 year-old Mother has out-hacked me with Sugru&rdquo;</p>

<p>My mother isn&rsquo;t obviously technical but she is incredibly practical. This is a woman, who at the age of 12, was sent to live with her widowed Grandfather, to take care of him! Nothing fazes her.</p>

<p>As she lives in Kilkenny, she always found the <a href="http://sugru.com">Sugru</a> story interesting (Jane, the inventor, is from Kilk) and bought a packet to see what it was about.</p>

<p>Now, have a look at this big plastic bowl.</p>

<p><a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/photo.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-740" title="photo" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/photo.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="576" /></a></p>

<p>Not exactly special.</p>

<p>Except it is.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s over 40 years old and has been used to make my Mum&rsquo;s legendary brown bread for that entire time.</p>

<p>A few years back it split on the side and Rose had been using various tapes etc to stop the bread mix leaking. But none were satisfactory. Then she thought of the Sugru. And it has worked perfectly. She&rsquo;s delighted with it. I figure it has another 40 years to go.</p>

<p>For me, that bowl represents a generation of people who hate waste and believe, in their DNA, that thrift should be celebrated. And Sugru is the perfect modern symbol of that.</p>

<p>My 8 y/o daughter and I put together this Lego case for <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a>. All design concepts are hers and she built it. My job was to make it all fit and not wobble. Which of course we did using <a href="http://sugru.com/">Sugru</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSCF1500.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-735" title="DSCF1500" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSCF1500-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="438" /></a></p>

<p>The case is a lot bigger than the RPi but that gives us expansion opportunities for USB hubs and battery packs. I like it and it will be our official Raspberry Pi case from now on.</p>

<p>Here are theinsides:</p>

<p>Finally a video showing it in action with the<a href="http://openelec.tv/">OpenElec</a> version of <a href="http://xbmc.org/">XBMC</a> playing Peppa Pig.</p>

<p>Oh, and here&rsquo;s another setup I did last week. RPi running on battery power with wireless mouse and Bluetooth portable fold-up keyboard. I&rsquo;ve ordered a cheap bluetooth mouse so I only need one USB port.</p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;Quick update on Eken T02 Tablet and where is Scribblenauts for Android?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I asked my 8 y/o daughter on Monday if there was anything she didn&rsquo;t like about her 88 Tablet after a week of ownership. I assumed she&rsquo;d gripe about the touch sensitivity of the screen, which I still see as a problem. Nope, she had a single criticism - the battery only lasts a couple of hours on a charge. Otherwise she loves it. She streams TV shows and movies across the homenetwork, browses the web and plays lots of games. Exactly what you want in a tablet.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m holding out for a 7&rdquo; one with slightly better CPU/GPU and an IPS screen. Should come in around the 110-130 mark. Maybe that Ainol Elf. I doubt I&rsquo;ll have to wait long.</p>

<p>As far as she is concerned, the only thing Android lacks is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scribblenauts">Scribblenauts</a>. Come on <a href="http://www.wbie.com/">5th Cell</a> and <a href="http://www.wbie.com/">WB Games</a>, get the finger out. Huge youth market for it, all moving away from NDS at the speed of light and not going to iOS.</p>

<p>I just checked out Sonic TheHedgehog4 Episode 1 on the Eken. However bad I thought Nintendo&rsquo;s future was looking before, this game confirmed that they are dead unless they bring out an Android gaming device in 2012.</p>
