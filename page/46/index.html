                        <p>#&ldquo;Sorting out the \&ldquo;On Behalf Of\&rdquo; Nonsense on GMail with AuthSMTP&rdquo;</p>

<p>I have long been pained by GMails handling of multiple &quot;From&quot; accounts. We use Google Apps For Your Domain which we generally like apart from that one feature.<p /><div>Obviously we have accounts like sales@ and support@ which are accessed by more than one of us. On the face of it GMail allows you to send from these addresses using your main account. So I can send a mail when logged in as conor@ but have it appear to be From sales@.</div> <p /><div>But Google insists on sticking an additional header called &quot;Sender&quot; which identifies that it really was conor@ who sent the mail. That then appears in the recipients Outlook Inbox as &quot;From conor@blah on behalf of sales@blah&quot;. This completely defeats the purpose of having generic group addresses. It means we can&#39;t have seamless &quot;tonight Matthew I&#39;m going to be Support&quot;.</div> <p /><div>But it turns out Google does have a solution for it and you can continue to use the web interface. When you are setting up those extra accounts you can tell Google not to use their servers to send but to use another SMTP server. They generally expect that to be your own mail server but we actually use <a href="http://www.authsmtp.com/">AuthSMTP</a> for all our automated sending from EC2 and it works perfectly here too. It&#39;s a very inexpensive solution which has never let us down. Highly recommended. (Note - enable SSL on your AuthSMTP account but don&#39;t on GMail).</div> <p /><div>Job done!</div></p>

<p>Twitter Emergency Rapid Response On-Site Reporting = TERROR <p /><div>No, acronyms have never been my strength.</div><p /><div>My CorkProbs idea on Twitter back in 2007 never got any traction. Mainly because there were possibly 10 people in Cork on Twitter at the time. The idea was simply that locals would tweet @CorkProbs about problems related to roads, electricity, gas, water etc and the account would re-tweet them. It was prompted by a water outage in Bandon where no-one in the Council could tell us what theproblemwas or take responsibility for finding out. The Twitter SMS interface was a big reason I thought it would catch on with normal people. Ah well.</div> <p /><div>I wasremindedof it again during the floods and freezing of November 2009. But it was really this winter where Twitter became the de-facto reporting system for weather, roads, floods and water outages. <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/iweatheronline">Irish Weather Online</a> almost made Met Eireann redundant in the past few weeks as we watched live reporting of the movement of snow across the country on <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23IWO">#IWO</a>.</div> <p /><div>I genuinely think Twitter has made the leap to being a Public Service Utility and should become a mandatory reporting system for all County Councils around the country.Of course being Ireland, we&#39;ll probably hire Bearing Point and pay them 100m to build a bad Irish knock-off of it instead.</div> <p /><div>I&#39;ve been building my list ofrequirementsfor anypoliticalparty to get my vote in 2011. I&#39;ve just added this to the list.</div></p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;What the hell ever happened to Twitter Annotations?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I got very excited earlier in the year when Twitter announced the Annotations feature. It&#39;s a way of adding metadata to a tweet such that it doesn&#39;t have to be user-visible. Of course the one use case that many of us thought of was reviews. You could add the rating, url etc as metadata and use the tweet for the summary. Then twitter clients could potentially interpret that and show reviews in Twitter with stars etc.<p /><div>But that&#39;s just one simple use case. Two others I was thinking of over Christmas were filters and hashtags.</div><p /><div>I know I know, my Filter Fetish continues unabated. But you could build a really effective filter tool if all of the Apps that posted to Twitter added some Annotations about themselves. So rather than clients trying to figure out that certain tweets are from Foursquare or Mafia Wars, apps would flag this in the attributes and you could mask all tweets from those sources with a single click. Like, <em>cough</em>, Facebook.</div> <p /><div>Hashtags are a wonderfully useful abomination. Such a simple &quot;feature&quot; provides incredible power for tracking topics but bloody hell, it can make Twitter an unreadable mess at times. Wouldn&#39;t it be so much better if hashtags went under the hood? The person or app generating the tweet would add the hashtags in a separate field (like tags in Wordpress) and they would be stored as annotations. Twitter clients could then hide them by default but make them visible if users wanted to see them.</div> <p /><div>There are so many useful ways Twitter could be improved using Annotations. It was announced at the <a href="http://gigaom.com/2010/04/14/twitter-launches-places-annotations-user-streams-for-developers/">Chirp Conference in April</a> but is still listed as &quot;not released to production&quot; <a href="http://dev.twitter.com/pages/annotations_overview">on the wiki</a>.</div> <p /><div>So what&#39;s the story Twitter? I find it hard to believe it is low priority, given how powerful a feature it could be. It would also allow a lot more normal people to feel ascomfortablewith Twitter as they do with Facebook. Is it proving hard to implement or scale?</div></p>

<p>Random brain-fart time. I jokingly suggested earlier that Twitter was just a front-end on the Skype IM system which is why both of them are down. <p /><div>Now I&#39;m sitting here thinking &quot;well ye know&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.&quot;</div><p /><div>Skype has the infrastructure, the contact lists and the userbase.</div><p /><div>Could they build both a single-threaded global system like Twitter with asymmetrical relationships and also a variation on their Groups feature, again where people can join rather than being invited?</div> <p /><div>I always remember that stupid but brilliantly compact line by Thesaurus Gillmor that Twitter was the new dialtone. Shouldn&#39;t that really be Skype&#39;s job?</div></p>

<p>I was thrilled to grab some Yahoo stickers at Le Web recently. They&#39;ll be worth loads when Yahoo is a long distant memory. I wondered where to put one and finally figured it out this evening. I cannot think of a more apt location. </p></p>

<p>Thanks to the brilliant Richard Trip, whose <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=690477">DeFroST ROM</a> I use every day on my phone, we now also have the a rough cut of <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=880465">Gingerbread on the Desire</a>. Initial impressions are that not much has changed except for some bling. I know most of the changes are under the hood. Seems to be rock solid. Haven&#39;t found any problems yet.</p></p>
