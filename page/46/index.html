<p>I&rsquo;ve had this for over ten years. It&rsquo;s a brilliant phone-line testing tool with some other bits. I&rsquo;ve lost the instructions and would love to know what the other bits are for. But for the life of me I cannot remember what it is called.</p>
<p>Anyone? Google Goggles was completely useless.</p>

<p>After talking about it a few times over the past few months, I finally decided to try working whilst standing today. The buzz around the idea on Twitter today presumably came from <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5735528/why-and-how-i-switched-to-a-standing-desk">Gina&#39;s post on Lifehacker</a>. Well worth a read. </p><p /><div>I am going for the environmentally friendly (aka zero cost) option of two cardboard boxes to implement my Standing Desk. Amazingly it is working really well and the boxes are at exactly the right level. The pressure on my wrists was immediately relieved. Hopefully the RSI in my right arm, which has left two of my fingers numb for six months, will finally ease.</div> <p /><div>It&#39;s a bit hard on the feet/legs but in a useful way since it forces me to move around on my feet as I type. I&#39;ve been standing for the past five hours or so and I don&#39;t feel any real need to sit down. I&#39;m even taking calls whilst standing. My guess is that my intermittent treadmill training is helping me here.</div> <p /><div>The only change I may make is to raise the monitor. Right now it is at the normal level but tilted up towards me.</div><p /><div>My only worry is that my gorgeous legs could be ruined by varicose veins. My career as a leg model could go up in smoke. I switched to lightweight Asics runners after lunch. Probably better for my feet.</div></p>

 <p>As opposed to Decency Filters :-)
</p><p>I've only just started playing with the feature and amazingly, it isn't just the best implementation on a mobile, it's the best implementation anywhere. 
</p><p>Your can mute people, hashtags or keywords.
</p><p>Tweetdeck, Seesmic et al should be ashamed of themselves for the lack of progress in this area on the desktop.
</p><p>Speaking of which there is a Chrome plugin for Twitter which does filtering called Slipstream. I tried it out but it only allows one exact word/phrase per filter and only works on twitter.com. Worth a look tho if that's all you need.</p></div>

<div class="posterous_quote_citation">via <a href="http://www.eurodroid.com/2011/01/parrot-asteroid-android-for-your-car-stereo/">eurodroid.com</a></div>
<p>One of the best tech purchases I made over the past few years was a Lidl Bluetooth car stereo. My old built-in Ford RDS6000 no longer played CDs and never had a line-in so it had to go.</p>
<p>The Lidl (and Aldi equivalent) units are fantastic. They have line-in, USB, SD Card, CD Player, Radio, A2DP Bluetooth and a hands-free kit. All for about &euro;80.</p>
<p>But I was thinking a few months back that the Germans (and thousands of Chinese manufacturers) could build something better and cheaper.</p>
<p>The thing is, I have never used the CD player in that head-unit. I either plug in a USB stick with music, an SD card with music, or, most commonly, I pair my Android phone using Bluetooth and stream all my music and podcasts from that.</p>
<p>The CD player adds unnecessary weight, cost and complexity. What we need are better Bluetooth controls on these head-units. My wife's one can instruct my phone to go up and down a track but mine can't. I don't want a touch screen like the Parrot above, I want maybe 5 or 6 giant chunky buttons and/or a dial and I want the display to tell me the folder/artist/album/song being played on Bluetooth.</p>
<p>Basically something like that Sony Ericsson LiveView but on a much bigger scale with the usual speaker connections etc at the back. I just find that messing with a touch-screen phone to change tracks/albums etc is a nightmare/dangerous when you are driving.</p>
<p>p.s. I recently discovered that my HTC Desire (and I'm sure many other phones) can pair separately for media and calls. So I have media going to the car stereo but I have calls going to a bog-standard Plantronics headset. I just find that those I am talking to get better sound quality with the Plantronics. The phone is smart enough to mute media when a call is in progress.</p>

<p><p><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;">There is one area where the internet has gone backwards in the past 10 years and that&rsquo;s discussion sites. From 1992 to probably 2003, I got a huge amount of information using Usenet, more than I got on the web. Unfortunately, despite still existing in 2011, Usenet has become a spam hellhole and most discussions have moved to the web.
<p />
<div>If you go onto most of these sites, you&rsquo;ll probably see vBulletin, phpBB, BBPress or some other crime against humanity powering it. I must be one of the few technical people in Ireland who has made less than 10 posts on boards.ie since it started. Possibly less than 5. I only ever end up there if it&rsquo;s a google result. I value my sanity and time too much.</div>
<p />
<div>The usability on all of those sites is truly shocking. I am stunned that people put up with it. Back in the day&hellip;&hellip;.hold on whilst I get my pipe and slippers&hellip;&hellip;.we had incredibly powerful desktop apps called newsreaders. Emacs had a great one called Gnus but my favourite was Forte Agent. This was a tool built for managing a deluge of intricately threaded messages and it did so brilliantly. You could monitor, find, filter and score everything you were interested in so that you could get in and out as quickly as possible.</div>
<p />
<div>Here&rsquo;s a sample screenshot:</div>

</div>
<p />
<div>Now let&rsquo;s have a look at the crap people are putting up with in 2011. Over on XDA-Developers, there is a discussion about DeFroST which is a superb community firmware for the HTC Desire. It&rsquo;s what I run. Here&rsquo;s a screenshot:</div>

<p />
<div>Note what it says: Page 1 of 1812. 1&hellip;&hellip;of&hellip;&hellip;.1812. That&rsquo;s state of the art for discussion software. One thousand eight hundred and 12 pages of unorganised messages about a single subject.</div>

                        <p>#&ldquo;Sorting out the \&ldquo;On Behalf Of\&rdquo; Nonsense on GMail with AuthSMTP&rdquo;</p>

<p>I have long been pained by GMails handling of multiple &quot;From&quot; accounts. We use Google Apps For Your Domain which we generally like apart from that one feature.<p /><div>Obviously we have accounts like sales@ and support@ which are accessed by more than one of us. On the face of it GMail allows you to send from these addresses using your main account. So I can send a mail when logged in as conor@ but have it appear to be From sales@.</div> <p /><div>But Google insists on sticking an additional header called &quot;Sender&quot; which identifies that it really was conor@ who sent the mail. That then appears in the recipients Outlook Inbox as &quot;From conor@blah on behalf of sales@blah&quot;. This completely defeats the purpose of having generic group addresses. It means we can&#39;t have seamless &quot;tonight Matthew I&#39;m going to be Support&quot;.</div> <p /><div>But it turns out Google does have a solution for it and you can continue to use the web interface. When you are setting up those extra accounts you can tell Google not to use their servers to send but to use another SMTP server. They generally expect that to be your own mail server but we actually use <a href="http://www.authsmtp.com/">AuthSMTP</a> for all our automated sending from EC2 and it works perfectly here too. It&#39;s a very inexpensive solution which has never let us down. Highly recommended. (Note - enable SSL on your AuthSMTP account but don&#39;t on GMail).</div> <p /><div>Job done!</div></p>
