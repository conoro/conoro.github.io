<p><p>After some more reading on the lack of Paid Apps in Ireland, it appears that all the blame may not be on Google after all. From what I can see, Mobile Operators in each country have to sign up to the Open Handset Alliance (OHA) to get &ldquo;access&rdquo; to the Android Market.</p>
<p>How much do you bet that none of the Irish operators have done so?</p>
<p>We know that Three UK SIMs work in Vodafone Ireland HTC Desires. I&rsquo;m pretty confident that they&rsquo;ll work in all other Irish Android handsets since the operators are just box-shifting rather than getting custom versions done.</p>
<p>Those Three SIMs are free.</p>
<p>In the 1970s, there were a series of famous train journeys to the North where motivated modern people went to buy tons of condoms and distribute them down South where they were banned by the local yokels.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s organise a follow-up.</p>
<p>Swarms of desperate Android owners and their friends grabbing fistfuls of free 3UK SIMs in Belfast and Newry, bringing them back over the border and distributing them to the hungry-for-apps hordes?</p>
<p>You know it makes sense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do we want?&rdquo; &ldquo;Paid Apps&rdquo; &ldquo;When do we want them?&rdquo; &ldquo;Now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The revolution is upon us.</p>
<p></p></p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;Nokia - So long, farewell, auf Wiedersehen, Hyv\u00e4sti&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I was a mobile phone late adopter for a very long time.After a couple of crappy feature phones from the likes of Panasonic in the 1990s, I got my first decent Nokia in 2000, the legendary 6210.</p>
<p><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>
<img alt="Nokia-6210" height="350" src="http://getfile8.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/temp-2010-05-02/IEGnnBfAmyoGGJHmFndIilHlwfjwhtnqAlaqkpimtvoqsAcGawwknBeIkbxI/nokia-6210.jpg.scaled500.jpg" width="250" />
</div>
</p>
<p>I hung on to that for ages and then finally upgraded to the equally beloved 6230i in 2004.</p>
<p><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>
<img alt="Nokia-6230_cc_149d_pop" height="303" src="http://getfile9.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/temp-2010-05-02/harCClsxJvrJJwgbGBnpgmpysdpBHGszdGhjIkfrreaIIDAlGekuCjaqGavq/nokia-6230_cc_149d_pop.jpg.scaled500.jpg" width="350" />
</div>
</p>
<p>I only joined the ranks of smartphone owners in 2006 when I got the N70. Not Nokia&rsquo;s greatest phone but good enough to make me want more.</p>
<p><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>
<img alt="Nokia_n70" height="295" src="http://getfile8.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/temp-2010-05-02/rpbCJpknFEhfAsjhFIABxsdtjxjfHbuvIwcrGslGcgCljFCwJnwdcjHJjzsa/nokia_n70.jpg.scaled500.jpg" width="300" />
</div>
</p>
<p>Then finally in 2007, I got Nokia&rsquo;s (still) best ever phone, the N95-8GB.</p>
<p><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>
<img alt="Nokia-n95-8gb-300x220" height="220" src="http://getfile4.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/temp-2010-05-02/tmdmCynmDHwkHkpyjHGcEekuxEniIFvBiFBjvstaqzhCBrHEaoHAwxGjgehg/Nokia-N95-8GB-300x220.jpg.scaled500.jpg" width="300" />
</div>
</p>
<p>On Friday, I powered down the N95-8GB and probably won&rsquo;t power it back up again unless I need its camera for some Qik streaming.On Friday I also powered up my new HTC Desire.</p>
<p><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>
<img alt="Htc-desire" height="283" src="http://getfile7.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/temp-2010-05-02/iJAyhtqasJnuDgJBuHjomJFdoxlFHqjgpdGfenDqslrdibbGtnmurnlFJExa/htc-desire.jpg.scaled500.jpg" width="330" />
</div>
</p>
<p>Nothing that Nokia sells now or has announced for the rest of <sup>2010</sup>&frasl;<sub>2011</sub> holds any interest for me. And the shafting of N95 owners over the free Ovi Maps says that Nokia has no interest in me as a customer either.I think they are a bit like the Catholic church who have realised there is more money/souls to be had in the developing world than trying to compete for attention at the high end in the developed world.</p>
<p>End of an era for me.</p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;Dear Vodafone/Meteor/O2, please give Google a hard slap from Irish Android Owners&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>The first Google Android phone went on sale in Ireland at the start of November 2009. It is now May 2010. And we still don&rsquo;t have Paid Apps in Ireland. All of the networks are losing Android phone sales because of this and all of those people who have Android phone are pissed off and wishing they&rsquo;d bought bloody iPhones.</p>
<p>What the hell is the hold up Google?</p>
<p>As I have posted here many times, I can stick a PAYG Three UK SIM in my phone when in Ireland and see all of the paid apps. I can then buy them in Google Checkout using my Irish Credit Card.</p>
<p>There is even an app out there to trick the phones into thinking there are not in Ireland to achieve the same thing.</p>
<p>So the problem is not technical.</p>
<p>Where is the problem? Taxation? Surely you have that sorted, given the billions you run through the Irish operations here?</p>
<p>Not setup to get your 30% cut? 30% of SFA is still SFA. The rev-share you&rsquo;ll get in Ireland on App sales would barely cover petty cash for paper-clips in Mountain View.</p>
<p>I would guess that minimal revenue is the reason until you look at the list of enabled countries. It&rsquo;s tiny.</p>
<p><span>
<ul>
<li>Australia</li>
<li>Austria</li>
<li>Canada</li>

<li>Netherlands</li>
<li>New Zealand</li>
<li>Spain</li>
<li>Switzerland</li>
<li>United Kingdom</li>
<li>United States</li>
</ul>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think I have seen that change in more than 6 months.</p>
<p>Wait a second. New Zealand? Are you kidding me?</p>
<p>Sort this.</p>
<p>Now.</p>

<p><p>You thought this post was going to be about turn-by-turn voice navigation on Google Maps for Ireland didn&rsquo;t you? Hah! (That&rsquo;s the next post).</p>
<p>No, this is far more important.</p>
<p>There is now a decent ZX Spectrum emulator for Android called Xpectroid and I&rsquo;ve been running the games I wrote from 1984-1986 on it.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a few screenshots of it in action. Having a few usability and sound problems but dammit, <strong>I can run Z80 assembler programs I wrote 25 years ago on my phone</strong>. Aren&rsquo;t computers great? As many Irish grannies would say.</p>

The Grid, my first published game in the Your Spectrum final issue December 1985. It&rsquo;s a clone of a few games of the time. Eat the dots, avoid the bullets. Like the rest of the games approx 4K of pure Z80 assembler that the magazine readers had to enter by hand on a rubber keyboard. Plays very well on the HTC G1. Not sure how the hell you play it (or the others) on an Android phone without a physical keyboard.</p>

Cent The Pete. I think this was published in Your Spectrum/Your Sinclair. Not 100% sure, must dig into the online issues.</p>

<p>I then started my magnum opus which was to be a funny platform/puzzle game in the style of Everyone&rsquo;s A Wally and Jet Set Willy. I wrote 10s of K of assembler on paper but never got it into a computer to try out. Many months spent writing edge detectionalgorithmsto sense items impacting each other.Then girls, college and drinkin got in the way.Some day I&rsquo;ll pay someone to type it all in and see what it does!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still digesting all of the announcements from Facebook&rsquo;s F8 conference yesterday. Lots of brilliant stuff in there which has me excited. Interesting contrast to the catastrophe that was Google Buzz.</p>
<p>There is some work for us to switch from Facebook Connect by the looks of things but no biggie.</p>
<p>This post from Ed Dale is incredibly important and I have to admit I missed the key news too. The new Facebook &ldquo;Like&rdquo; buttons, that you can expect to see everywhere very soon, do something which increases the value of Facebook as an Ad platform by several orders of magnitude. They update your profile.</p>
<p>Like everyone else, I thought it was a Wall thing (and question whether people want their Wall to be a long list of product/site pimpages). But the buttonsd actually update your permanent profile that you filled out initially (interests/likes etc).</p>
<p>So when those of us who do Ads on Facebook want to demographically target people, we now have up-to-date detailed information based on your explicit recent &ldquo;Like&rdquo; activity, not the few interests (&ldquo;Music&rdquo;, &ldquo;Hummus&rdquo;) you thought of two years ago when you joined Facebook or when you clicked &ldquo;Skip&rdquo; during that part of the sign-up process.</p>
<p>This is a very very very powerful change and if I was the Google AdWords team, I would now be officially soiling myself.</p>
<p>Read the rest of Ed&rsquo;s post for more detail and thoughts.</p>

 <p>I&rsquo;ve been sharing links to Scott Adams strips since the mid-1990s.
</p><p>In fact, in Integral Design, my entire cubicle was covered in the best ones from his calendars. Yes, sad I know.
