                        <p>#&ldquo;Notch makes getting fit a little less po-faced&rdquo;</p>

<p>Getting fit and losing weight is a very serious subject. But it shouldn&rsquo;t be. All the talk of burn and crunch and walls and plank and core and bootcamps and weigh-ins would put anyone off. No wonder so many people are obese.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been reading Scott Jurek&rsquo;s book <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Eat-Run-Ultramarathon-Greatness-ebook/dp/B005OCHOZS">Eat &amp; Run</a> for the past while and it&rsquo;s incredibly inspirational. Not in a happy-clappy sense but in the pure joy of running that leaps off the page. This guy runs 150 mile ultras all the time, including through Death Valley and is a vegan. When I&rsquo;m running 12 miles slowly around Bandon and staring to fade, I just think about some of the stuff in his book and I recover quickly.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why I found <a href="http://notch.me">Notch.me</a> so brilliant this week. It takes your Fitbit or <a href="http://www.runkeeper.com">RunKeeper</a> info and turns it into a very funny infographic. I think RunKeeper should integrate it into the mobile app. It&rsquo;s a damn sight more motivational than their robot voice at the end of the run saying &ldquo;You ran 14 miles in 3 hours and 4 seconds. Your average pace was blah blah blah&rdquo;.</p>

<p>We need to put joy back into exercise and fitness. I hope Notch.me is just a start.</p>

<p>Click through for the full infographic.</p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;APIs, Web Services, Cloud, AWS - Slides from my talk yesterday at #OFFSITE2012&rdquo;</p>

<p>The first ever <a href="http://www.offsite.ie">OFFSITE</a> event in West Cork yesterday was a big success. I learned a lot from all the other speakers both about technology and business. The real stand-out for me was <a href="http://twitter.com/sf9">Ger Keohane</a>&rsquo;s talk on eCommerce conversions. It was pretty stunning how you can seriously improve conversions to actual purchase with some very non-obvious changes.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m really pleased to see the <a href="http://www.wcdp.ie/">West Cork Development Partnership</a> get into the area of supporting local tech enterprises in addition to all the other areas they have supported over the years. If you are in West Cork and you are thinking about doing anything on the web or mobile, make sure to get in contact with <a href="mailto:david@wcdp.ie">David Tuohy</a> there.</p>

<p>My talk on Web Services and moving to the cloud was a bit of a mish-mash. I was trying to cram a lot of info into 20 minutes. Unfortunately there is no video or audio so you&rsquo;ll have to try and guess what some of my analogies mean e.g. Pig vs Waifos, FlyLo vs Butlins. Leave a comment if you get stuck :-)</p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;Harbour Hopping in West Cork - Apple uses Google Maps hand-me-downs&rdquo;</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve had much hilarity online today over the awfulness of Apple&rsquo;s new iOS6 Maps. I finally just got it installed on the iPad and of course decided to check the local situation. Actually notdisastrous. The golf club is notlabelledas an airship landing strip for a start. But then I spotted something interesting.</p>

<p>Back about 6 years ago, Google Maps was completely useless in West Cork. At one point it seemed to think there was only one road down here, the N71. Andbizarrelyit wasn&rsquo;t labelled as the N71, it was called &ldquo;Harbour Hopping in South West Cork&rdquo;. Seriously, that&rsquo;s what Google thought the road was called. I never found out how such a ridiculous bug got into the data.</p>

<p>Eventually Google re-mapped the country itself and bought some better data. Their maps around here are now pretty fantastic and Streetview even went up tiny one-car-wide lanes locally.</p>

<p>So imagine my surprise when I saw this on the iPad:</p>

<p>I mentioned the <a href="http://offsite.ie/event-agenda/">OFFSITE Conference</a> over on <a href="http://www.web2ireland.org/2012/09/03/west-corks-first-major-tech-conference-offsite/">Web2Ireland</a> recently. It&rsquo;s the frst time a major technology event is being held in West Cork and everyone in business in Munster and beyond should consider attending. It&rsquo;s all happening next week, 27th September in Rosscarbery.</p>

<p><a href="http://offsite.ie/event-agenda/"><img class="size-medium wp-image-856 aligncenter" title="header-bg" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/header-bg-300x60.png" alt="" width="300" height="60" /></a></p>

<p>The title of my talk is &ldquo;<em>Building on The Shoulders of Giants: How Irish businesses can quickly deliver Enterprise-quality products through the smart use of software services</em>&ldquo;</p>

<p>The bulk of the talk will be about all the lessons we have learned over the past few years in running the <a href="http://www.loudervoice.com/">LouderVoice</a> service on a cloud infrastructure and how you could do similar.</p>

<p>Some of the topics I&rsquo;ll be covering include:
<ul>
    <li>Building a SaaS business</li>
    <li>Amazon Web Services (EC2, EBS, EIP, RDS, S3, CloudFront, CloudWatch)</li>
    <li>IaaS vs PaaS (AWS vs Google vs Cloud Foundry vs Azure etc)</li>
    <li>Tying it all together with APIs</li>
    <li>Scaling</li>
    <li>Pricing and Cost Monitoring</li>
    <li>Robustness Cost-Benefit</li>
    <li>Pitfalls</li>
    <li>What&rsquo;s Next?</li>
    <li>Big Data Opportunities</li>
    <li>Open Data Opportunities</li>
</ul>
This won&rsquo;t be a geek-out session, it will be a business-centric talk where I hope those who are looking at the cloud get a lot of useful tips and cautions.</p>

<p>Let me know if there is anything in particular you would like to hear about.</p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;Standing Desk Update&rdquo;</p>

<p>My standing desk experiments have been intermittent but I&rsquo;ve put some renewed effort in recently due to some back twinges. I finally cleared out the tiny annex office off my main office and changed the standing desk over to my main laptop.</p>

<p><img class="alignnone" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-PHy7o9YZt-s/UFbu2t09wdI/AAAAAAAAi0M/ADd7EW7ZTQ4/s800/2012-09-17%25252009.58.27.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="800" /></p>

<p>Overall it works brilliantly and is more stable than the previous set of cardboard boxes :-) The floor mat is important to avoid getting sore heels. I either go barefoot or wear the Vibrams when standing.</p>

<p>The main lesson learned is that it&rsquo;s not something you should do 12 hours a day. Mix it up and make sure to keep moving, don&rsquo;t stay stationary for long periods. I generally take phone calls sitting down or when I have to read long technical documents. I think trying to read too much from a screen that is a few feet away whilst swaying slightly on your feet is just too hard.</p>

<p>Anyone else been trying it out? Any lessons learned you&rsquo;d like to share?</p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;How the hell did I miss the upcoming shutdown of FeedBurner? Another lesson in lock-in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>How the hell did I miss the fact that Google is shutting down FeedBurner in October?</p>

<p>I always remember Dave Winer <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2007/07/21/whyFeedburnerIsTrouble.html">warning all us bloggers</a> back in 2007 that we were nuts to insert a single company between us and our readers.Most of us thought he was being a crank. It turns out he was right.</p>

<p>My big worry is that we will all lose all of our Blog Subscribers. In my case, built up over 11 years. I&rsquo;ll be optimistic and assume some sort of skeleton FeedBurner service will exist which will 301 re-direct all the feeds to the original sources.</p>

<p>Great round-up piece on the problem by <a href="http://www.nevillehobson.com/2012/09/09/prepare-for-goodbye-feedburner-in-october-2012/">Neville Hobson</a>. Two solutions <a href="http://threads.scripting.com/8312ByDw/theFutureOfFeedburner">offered by Dave</a>.</p>

<p>How many times are we going to fall for this before we learn? We see a service that offers us some really nice benefits for free (FeedBurner, Facebook , Twitter, etc etc). Then we choose to ignore what will happen if they go away or change the rules or just break. We decide lock-in is a fair swap for free. Then they go away or change the rules or just break. And we&rsquo;re left high and dry, swearing never again. Until the next time.</p>

<p>Luckily I&rsquo;ve only got two blogs left using FeedBurner. Unluckily they are the two most trafficked. I&rsquo;ll see if I can do the CNAME transition before D-Day and report back.</p>

<p>UPDATE: Someone left a comment on Google+ saying that it is just specific APIs that are getting shutdown, not the overall service. If I can confirm that, I&rsquo;ll report back. Meanwhile, I&rsquo;m still going to make the CNAME move.</p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;Sugru + Old Mondeo = Yay&rdquo;</p>

<p>My ancient old Ford Mondeo (2001) is still going strong. In some ways I hate it for doing so. It&rsquo;s an appliance and I don&rsquo;t like appliances, I like things with character. Prior to it I only bought Citroens (BX, AX, Xantia) and I loved them dearly. But they were unreliable piles of junk assembled by drunks. Then, once we had kids, an appliance became necessary.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;New&rdquo; Mondeo was the second car in the renaissance of Ford. The first was the Focus in 1999. My wife had a Focus and it was as close to perfect a car as you could get. Interesting shapes inside and out, totally reliable and not a generic over-priced BMW. Her sister drove it for a few years after her and loved it too. The Mondeo kept the reliability of the Focus but was dead boring to look at, inside and out.</p>

<p>In 11 years, the only problems it has had are a badly designed handbrake and grab handles which pop out of the ceiling. It also loses the gas in the aircon too quickly and it needed a suspension joint replaced a few years ago. It gets one service a year across the road for 100+ and that&rsquo;s it.</p>

<p>120,000 miles later and it bombs up and down the M7/M8 like a new car.</p>

<p>But in all this time, one thing has bugged me every day. The dashboard has a stippled effect which is a magnet for dust but is also impossible to attach anything too. Particularly phone holders. So I&rsquo;ve always had to attach them to the windscreen. The problem there is that the angle of the screen is so severe, it is always awkward, in landscape-mode, far away and murdered by glare. In France, on holidays in July, the HTC Sensation overheated so badly using Google Maps Navigation that a 2 Amp charger couldn&rsquo;t keep the battery charged!</p>

<p>Then yesterday, 11 years later, I had a brainwave. Sugru:</p>

<p>And ye know what? It flippin works!</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s to another 120,000 miles.</p>

                        <p>#&rdquo;\&ldquo;Games You May Like on Facebook\&ldquo;. That&rsquo;d be None. Why are Ads so broken in 2012?&rdquo;</p>

<p>If Facebook paid even a minutes notice to the intention graph rather than the social graph, they&rsquo;d see that I relentlessly click Hide on all mentions of games. Then maybe they could avoid wasting their valuable screen real-estate pimping something I will never ever ever click on.</p>

<p>I also had a look at some of the ads on FB today. Bloody hell, not a single solitary thing I&rsquo;m remotely interested in. Just because I&rsquo;m friends/family with someone on Facebook does not mean I share any of their interests. But when we talk about a movie/TV show/book/product, then you&rsquo;ve got some useful data.</p>

<p>Given the amount of Likes and Shares I do on Facebook, it really is shocking that they can&rsquo;t find one thing to recommend to me that I&rsquo;d actually buy. It doesn&rsquo;t surprise me at all that their Ad revenue has flattened out.</p>

<p>I really hope someone out there is working on an all new Ads system. I don&rsquo;t mind Ads, I really don&rsquo;t, but I haven&rsquo;t clicked on one in a very long time.</p>

<p>With the amount of &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; I generate online, someone should be able to nail me with ads I can&rsquo;t resist. Yet here we are in 2012 and I still find out about most of the products I buy from people I follow on Twitter/Facebook/Google+, Blogs and Friends. Personal recommendations plus a selection of online reviews seals the deal. There must be a way of packaging that up algorithmic-ally without turning everyone into shills.</p>

<p>Whilst I&rsquo;m on the subject, can all the re-marketing systems please add a button to their Ads called &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already bloody bought it, stop hounding me.&rdquo;? Also another one for all the deals Ads which says &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a man, I don&rsquo;t need an upper lip electrolysis deal of the day&rdquo;</p>

<p>In fact, if an Ad system was announced which said &ldquo;Give us access to your Twitter/Facebook/Google+/Reader/Amazon/4SQ/Yelp accounts and we promise to only show you Ads/Deals for stuff you and your friends talk about positively&rdquo;, I&rsquo;d opt-in tomorrow.</p>

<p>Meanwhile here&rsquo;s a sponsored Tweet from Coke.</p>

<p>These are the slides from a talk I gave back in March to the UCC SME Cloud Incubator Workshop. It goes through all the details of our use of Amazon Web Services with some mentions of other cloud providers too.</p>

<p>I saw this in the control panel for one of my Google Apps for Your Domain accounts today.</p>

<p><a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/googleapps1.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-844" title="googleapps" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/googleapps1.png" alt="" width="783" height="344" /></a></p>

<p>The value-add for paid accounts on Google Apps has always been very poor. $50 per user for a few tweaks most people don&rsquo;t need. This could change things, particularly for those who want to use Google+ as a replacement for Yammer.</p>
