                        <p>#&ldquo;Google Hangouts Extensions point to a richer Google+ Platform future&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yesterday <a href="http://hackaday.com/2012/10/22/add-an-arduino-to-a-google-hangout/">I read about</a> a delightful project involving LEDs, Arduino, Processing, Node.js, Google+ and Google Hangouts.</p>

<p>I was originally interested due to the Arduino angle but then I realised there was something extremely powerful going on with Google+ Hangouts and had to <a href="http://robobrrd.com/learn/googleplus/">dig in more</a>.</p>

<p>Have a look at the video first, it&rsquo;s an extremely cool mashing together of a bunch of things.</p>

<p>httpv://youtu.be/Y1bdxf9tZWw</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how the <a href="https://developers.google.com/+/hangouts/">Hangouts Extensions and API</a> announcements passed me by, but they are a really fantastic idea. To quote Google:
<blockquote>The Google+ Hangouts API allows you to develop collaborative apps that run inside of a Google+ Hangout. Hangout apps behave much like normal web apps, but with the addition of the rich, real-time functionality provided by the Hangouts APIs. Apps have the ability to control aspects of the user interface, synchronize data between hangout participants, and respond to various events in the hangout.</blockquote>
So in the video above, it&rsquo;s a simple LED toggle that anyone on the Hangout can flick. The Google example mentions games but really anything involving user interaction is possible. I think I now understand how Red Bull managed to integrate a Twitter stream with the Live Hangout of Felix Baumgartner!</p>

<p>What else? Live Polls obviously. Did anyone use it to do realtime voting during last night&rsquo;s presidential debate?The showcase also highlights Slideshare and Pulse News.</p>

<p>Whilst I am extremely impressed by the Hangouts API, it reminded me yet again of the giant hole at the heart of Google+. I&rsquo;ve said it many times before but Facebook&rsquo;s approach is still 100% correct. Provide a Platform and APIs and let developers/businesses provide the ideas and innovation. Facebook is a flavour factory, Google+ is currently vanilla only.</p>

<p>But the Hangout API and Extensions give me hope. If that type of wide-open functionality is made available in every part of Google+ (particularly Business and Local Pages), then Facebook has some real competition on its hands. That&rsquo;s good for both Google and Facebook. And of course, us.</p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;MIT App Inventor Official Open-Source Release&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m really pleased to see this release happen. Dec/Jan was an awkward time as Google dropped App Inventor and MIT didn&rsquo;t have their site ready. MIT has done a sterling job since and it&rsquo;s great to know that the <a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/appinventor-sources/">full up-to-date source code is available</a>. I hope a community of contributors to the codebase now starts building up.</p>

<p>One issue we ran into in our school with accessing the main MIT site and GAE was a lack of bandwidth. When you have 15 laptops all trying to download/upload Java Apps to the internet on a connection that I think is 512kbs, you are going to have problems.</p>

<p>So a private local App Inventor install means we could provision an old PC as an Ubuntu server in the school and serve everything over local wifi. I hope the dev server capabilities are improved beyond &ldquo;a few users&rdquo; so we can remove the dependency on Google App Engine and provide a trouble free setup for the kids.</p>

<p>Limor &ldquo;Ladyada&rdquo; Fried of <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/">Adafruit</a> has put together a really lovely colouring book called <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/products/1000">E is for Electronics</a>. It has everything from A-is-for-Ampere to Z-is-for-Zener-Diode. You can buy it online for $10 or just print it off using the booklet setting of your printer. I printed one for our 8 y/o daughter and she is a big fan. I&rsquo;ve just done another copy our 7 y/o son. I&rsquo;ll order some as stocking fillers too.</p>

<p><a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/1000frontcover_MED.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-879 aligncenter" title="1000frontcover_MED" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/1000frontcover_MED.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="308" /></a></p>

<p>Yesterday I also spotted a really neat set of products over on <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/">Sparkfun</a>. They are paper projects like <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11522">greeting cards</a> and <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11523">mini &ldquo;night-lights&rdquo;</a> that use a <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11521">conductive pen</a> for the wiring. I&rsquo;m going to order one today but in the meantime, I have downloaded the PDFs and will do a rough version of the night-light using wire and bits I already have.</p>

<p>This whole idea of Open Source hardware and designs really has me excited. Back in 1994 I built my first ever GCC cross-compiler and compiled an <a href="http://www.rtems.org/">Open Source RTOS</a>. In 1995 I installed <a href="http://www.slackware.com/">Slackware Linux</a> for the first time. That&rsquo;s when I knew that everything in software was going to change forever. It&rsquo;s exactly how I feel about hardware and electronics now. In fact, it&rsquo;s fun to realise I have sort of come full circle in 30 years:</p>

<p>ZX Spectrum -&gt; Electronics in College -&gt; Embedded Software -&gt; The Internet -&gt; The Social Web -&gt; Arduino+RaspberryPi -&gt; The Internet of Things -&gt; ????</p>

<p>So what is &ldquo;????&rdquo;? I think is <strong><em>IoT+Social</em></strong>. Everything and everyone network-connected, with all that data being crunched and used real-time, in ways we can&rsquo;t even guess at yet.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always loved Mark Zuckerberg&rsquo;s description of Facebook as &ldquo;A Social Utility&rdquo;. I don&rsquo;t think FB is anywhere near that yet, but one of the big guys like them is going to have to be the enabler, if Social IoT is to work.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I have some spooky eyeballs to make for my daughters for trick-or-treat using LEDs and push-buttons.</p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;Playing 1980s games on your Raspberry Pi and remembering Mike Singleton&rdquo;</p>

<p>This post was going to be just an up-to-date summary of many other articles out there on this subject. With the rapid rate of change in the RPi world, even very recent guides have proven to be unusable quite quickly.</p>

<p>However I&rsquo;d first like to remember Mike Singleton who died last week. I didn&rsquo;t know his name until today when I read <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/forums/general-discussion/30/the-father-of-home-computer-gaming-died-last-week/564063/">this lovely piece about him</a>. But what I did know about was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lords_of_Midnight">Lords of Midnight</a> and Doomdark&rsquo;s Revenge. Those two adventure games dominated that category on the ZX Spectrum in the mid-80s. Mike was still creating new games until very recently. It&rsquo;s just another reminder of how important the 1980s UK home computer scene has been to the current gaming industry. In memory of Mike, I&rsquo;m playing Lords of Midnight from the start again this evening on the Raspberry Pi. RIP.</p>

<p><a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Fuse_001.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-875" title="Fuse_001" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Fuse_001.png" alt="" width="962" height="776" /></a></p>

<p>The Raspberry Pi makes a brilliant base for old-school game emulation, just as it does for <a href="http://www.raspbmc.com/">XBMC</a>. You literally just need it, a USB joystick, maybe a wireless dongle, a TV and you are in business. I&rsquo;ve been very tempted to double-sided-sticky-tape one to the side of the TV without a case, it&rsquo;s that small. I&rsquo;m currently using an ancient 14&rdquo; Philips portable CRT to get the full retro effect, including blinding flickering.
<h2>Atari 2600</h2>
OK, I have to admit my rose-tinted spectacle were on overdrive here. The Atari 2600 Pacman in my head was actually thearcadeversion. The real thing is pretty awful. This console was a bit before my time and the main thing I remember about it were the completely unusable joysticks. But if you want to re-live that horror, then it&rsquo;s really very simple.</p>

<p>Grab all the Atari 2600 ROMs from one of many sites. They are tiny so the download takes no time at all.</p>

<p>Then install the Stella emulator:
<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo apt-get install stella</code></pre>
Then just run stella inside X Windows. More details <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/09/28/how-to-set-up-your-raspberry-pi-to-play-atari-2600-games/">here</a>.
<h2>MAME Arcade</h2>
MAME seems to have been around forever. It enables you to play old arcade games on a wide variety of machines. I remember using it on my brother-in-law&rsquo;s Atari 520ST in the 90s.</p>

<p>So it&rsquo;s no surprise it works well on the Raspberry Pi. Compiling from source apparently takes forever and some of the binaries from this summer don&rsquo;t work on the latest Debian release. However<a href="http://sheasilverman.com/rpi/raspbian/mameBin.zip">this latest compiled version</a> of Advance MAME <a href="http://blog.sheasilverman.com/2012/07/raspbian-on-raspberry-pi-mame-mess-quake3-neogeo-and-cave-story-binaries/">by Shea Silverman</a> runs perfectly on the latest Debian.</p>

<p>Download it to your home directory, then
<pre><code class="language-bash">
unzip mameBin.zip
sudo chmod 777 /dev/fb0
</code>
</pre>
Put your roms into ~/mame/share/advance/rom/
<pre><code class="language-bash">
cd mame/bin/
./advmame
</code>
</pre>
Edit the config file
<pre><code class="language-bash">nano ~/.advance/advmame.rc</code></pre>
to include the proper display configuration</p>

<p>For HDMI try:
<pre><code class="language-bash">device_video_clock 5 - 50 / 15.62 / 50 ; 5 - 50 / 15.73 / 60</code></pre>
For NTSC TVs try:
<pre><code class="language-bash">device_video_clock 5 - 50 / 15.73 / 60</code></pre>
For Composite PAL TVs:
<pre>device_video_clock 5 - 50 / 15.62 / 50 ; 5 - 50 / 15.73 / 60</pre>
Then run MAME with the name of the game e.g. pacman or zaxxon.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll leave it as an exercise for the reader to source their own legal ROMs.
<pre><code class="language-bash">
 cd mame/bin/
./advmame gamename
</code>
</pre>
<h2>ZX Spectrum</h2>
Installing the Fuse emulator is now trivial to do:
<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo apt-get install fuse-emulator-common fuse-emulator-utils spectrum-roms</code></pre>
Then grab your favourite games from <a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/">World of Spectrum</a> and run fuse inside X Windows. More details <a href="http://raspi.tv/2012/how-to-install-fuse-zx-spectrum-emulator-on-raspberry-pi">here</a>. And <a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0006604">Lords of Midnight here</a>.</p>

<p>There are ton of other emulators out there, at various levels of usability. Our eldest has already been asking about SNES.</p>

<p>The reason I like Clay Shirky&rsquo;s talks so much is because he communicates complex &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; in a way most people can understand.</p>

<p>Here he ties together Git, diffs and Government legislation beautifully. If you are similar with the law but not Git or diffs, it&rsquo;s well worth a watch. And vice versa.</p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;From tiny CSV acorns, many #OpenData oaks can grow. Now where is Ireland&rsquo;s CIO/CTO?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This has been a superb week in Ireland for showing what motivated geeks can do with even the most clunky of Government data. After the Oireachtas XML debacle, it was a joy to see the new <a href="http://www.propertypriceregister.ie/">Residential Property Price Register</a> site make its data available. Sure, it was poxy old CSV files per year and it was<a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2012/1003/1224324777284.html">riddled with errors</a> but I really am pleased with what it triggered.</p>

<p>Within hours of the data going up, we had:
<ol>
    <li><a href="http://www.thepropertypin.com/viewtopic.php?p=636239#p636239">Properties by Price Range</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://brianmlucey.wordpress.com/2012/09/30/full-property-price-details-ireland-jan-2010-sep-2012/">A merged Excel spreadsheet</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://yellowschedule.com/house_price_database_ireland/?order=date&amp;submit=1&amp;county=9&amp;sdate=1%2F1%2F2010&amp;edate=10%2F01%2F2012&amp;pricel=&amp;priceh=&amp;type=2&amp;search=Sallins+bridge">YellowSchedule</a> with a great search interface</li>
    <li><a href="http://irishproperty.herokuapp.com/">A Heroku-based App </a>with Search</li>
    <li><a href="http://conoroneill.net/quick-n-dirty-visualisation-of-2010-property-price-register-data-into-interactive-map/">My import into Google Fusion Tables</a> and the (patchy) Geo-Coding of the data</li>
</ol>
And by the end of the week we also had:
<ol>
    <li><a href="http://karlmonaghan.com/property/">Another searchable site</a> with maps</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.fmeireland.com/blog/32-analysing-property-prices-fme-ireland">Mapquest-based Geo-Coding</a></li>
    <li>Others?</li>
</ol>
In fact the only thing we seem to be missing is someone sticking a JSON API in the front of the data. UPDATE: <a href="http://conoroneill.net/from-tiny-csv-acorns-many-opendata-oaks-can-grow-now-where-is-irelands-ciocto/#comment-2771">See comment below</a> from Brendan. Nice one!</p>

<p>I hope those working on data in the Public Sector take encouragement and ideas from this. Most of what was done took very little work. I&rsquo;m sure many of the people involved would be only too happy to share their technical approaches.</p>

<p>If we all keep leading by example, I expect the quality and quantity of Public Sector Web Services and Data to improve in leaps and bounds over the next 12 months.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.argolon.com/2009/10/10/cio-for-ireland/">Three years ago next week</a>, I suggested a regular BarCamp called IRLCamp where public sector and private sector get together and present interesting projects, ideas and technologies and learn from each other. I still think we should do this.</p>

<p>Three years later we still need a CIO/CTO for Ireland too.</p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;Visualisation of Irish Property Price Register Data using Interactive Map from Google Fusion Tables&rdquo;</p>

<p>UPDATE:
Second attempt at this:</p>

<p>I just grabbed the three CSV files from the <a href="http://www.propertypriceregister.ie">Residential Property Price Register</a> site (why is a Captcha needed for that?). I merged some address columns in Excel and added &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; to all of the addresses. I then just imported into <a href="https://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?docid=1xttsr82Nw52F5DOSdKWnIe8w4TYuje4uX6mjrI4">Google Fusion Tables</a> and told it to Geo-Code the data.</p>

<p>Note that zero data validation has been done. Everything on this map may be completely wrong. I&rsquo;m sure some of the more obscure addresses (or non-unique ones) are missing.</p>

<p>Aha! There are daily limits on Geo-coding so I&rsquo;ll have to do this over a few days before the full map of points appears. But this is a decent start:</p>

<iframe width="500" height="300" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://www.google.com/fusiontables/embedviz?viz=MAP&amp;q=select+col4+from+1xttsr82Nw52F5DOSdKWnIe8w4TYuje4uX6mjrI4&amp;h=false&amp;lat=53.536001102923606&amp;lng=-8.18714663437504&amp;z=7&amp;t=1&amp;l=col4&amp;y=4&amp;tmplt=-1"></iframe>

<p>UPDATE 2:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?docid=19PUK2r504GNhZ_urpZkmaz-oyPxpMvTMkMnPmjE">2011 Fusion Table</a>. 2011 Map (this will populate properly over next few days too):</p>

<iframe width="800" height="800" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://www.google.com/fusiontables/embedviz?viz=MAP&amp;q=select+col1+from+19PUK2r504GNhZ_urpZkmaz-oyPxpMvTMkMnPmjE&amp;h=false&amp;lat=53.220334688404286&amp;lng=-7.637767390624957&amp;z=7&amp;t=1&amp;l=col1&amp;y=2&amp;tmplt=-1"></iframe>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?docid=1CsKIhomej-eNJUD9wUq2rxCbP2byrEdF0MaUk-Q">2012 Fusion Table</a>. 2012 Map (this will populate properly over next few days too):</p>

<iframe width="800" height="800" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://www.google.com/fusiontables/embedviz?viz=MAP&amp;q=select+col1+from+1CsKIhomej-eNJUD9wUq2rxCbP2byrEdF0MaUk-Q&amp;h=false&amp;lat=53.24549522839595&amp;lng=-367.547605421875&amp;z=7&amp;t=1&amp;l=col1&amp;y=2&amp;tmplt=-1"></iframe>

<p>UPDATE 3:
Replacement <a href="https://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?docid=1YAYJjzYXX8y67upZDygxIh91pFgdSEs4whzZfy0">2010 Fusion Table</a> and Map with Euro symbol correctly encoded:</p>

<iframe width="800" height="800" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://www.google.com/fusiontables/embedviz?viz=MAP&amp;q=select+col1+from+1YAYJjzYXX8y67upZDygxIh91pFgdSEs4whzZfy0&amp;h=false&amp;lat=52.69770046382954&amp;lng=-8.172728450000022&amp;z=7&amp;t=1&amp;l=col1&amp;y=2&amp;tmplt=-1"></iframe>

<p>UPDATE 4: Of course I should have pointed out earlier that the Fusion tables themselves are very useful. You can filter on location, date, price etc without having to fill-out a silly captcha.</p>

<p>Anyone interested in one aggregated Table/Map with all the data from all years in it?</p>

<p>UPDATE 5: As of 16:09 on Oct 1st, the 2012 and 2011 data is 100% geo-coded and 2010 is at 63%. However, based on Brendan&rsquo;s comments below, we may be missing a lot of data points because Google can&rsquo;t geo-code them. Once the process is complete, I&rsquo;ll see if we can extract the missing ones and manually adjust the addresses so that they work. There are also plenty of errors from what I can see.</p>

<p>UPDATE 6: As of 9am Oct 2nd, the final data from 2010 is now geo-coded. Short follow-up post to come on how Google could do far more intelligent and less error-prone geo-coding on Irish addresses without post-codes.</p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;Notch makes getting fit a little less po-faced&rdquo;</p>

<p>Getting fit and losing weight is a very serious subject. But it shouldn&rsquo;t be. All the talk of burn and crunch and walls and plank and core and bootcamps and weigh-ins would put anyone off. No wonder so many people are obese.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been reading Scott Jurek&rsquo;s book <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Eat-Run-Ultramarathon-Greatness-ebook/dp/B005OCHOZS">Eat &amp; Run</a> for the past while and it&rsquo;s incredibly inspirational. Not in a happy-clappy sense but in the pure joy of running that leaps off the page. This guy runs 150 mile ultras all the time, including through Death Valley and is a vegan. When I&rsquo;m running 12 miles slowly around Bandon and staring to fade, I just think about some of the stuff in his book and I recover quickly.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why I found <a href="http://notch.me">Notch.me</a> so brilliant this week. It takes your Fitbit or <a href="http://www.runkeeper.com">RunKeeper</a> info and turns it into a very funny infographic. I think RunKeeper should integrate it into the mobile app. It&rsquo;s a damn sight more motivational than their robot voice at the end of the run saying &ldquo;You ran 14 miles in 3 hours and 4 seconds. Your average pace was blah blah blah&rdquo;.</p>

<p>We need to put joy back into exercise and fitness. I hope Notch.me is just a start.</p>

<p>Click through for the full infographic.</p>
