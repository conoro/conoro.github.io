                        <p>#&ldquo;Underground Lakes, Antarctic UFOs, Nazis on The Moon and The Mayans&rdquo;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a funny old week when all of the above come together in your head isn&rsquo;t it? Bear with me for a sec.</p>

<p>As we all know, The Mayans predicted the world would end in 2012. This ties nicely into the long-awaited B-movie Iron Sky coming in April - &ldquo;In 1945 the Nazis went to the Moon. In 2012 they&rsquo;re coming back&rdquo;. Or something.
<p style="text-align: center;">httpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Py_IndUbcxc</p>
Then we hear that the Russians have finally <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-16907998">drilled into Lake Vostok</a> in Antarctica, releasing a likely plague of alienlife-form&hellip;movies.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-16907998"><img class="size-full wp-image-578 alignnone" title="_58383305_vostokfromtheair" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/58383305_vostokfromtheair.jpg" alt="" width="624" height="351" /></a></p>

<p>These three reminded me of a sci-fi book I read as a young teenager. Probably one that my Dad picked up in an airport in the early 80s. Of course I couldn&rsquo;t remember the name of it and spent 30 minutes googling variations of &ldquo;ufo, nazis, antarctica, sci-fi&rdquo;. Finally I found it, Genesis!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/GENESIS-ebook/dp/B004LLIF92/ref=tmm_kin_title_0?ie=UTF8&amp;m=AG56TWVU5XWC2"><img class="size-full wp-image-579 aligncenter" title="b59e81b0c8a05ffb5a8a8110.L" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/b59e81b0c8a05ffb5a8a8110.L.jpg" alt="" width="251" height="400" /></a></p>

<p>That plot has stuck in my head for the guts of 30 years. Brilliant, twisted and right on the edge of believable. Overly wordy sure, but he pressed all my teenage buttons.</p>

<p>But then it got even better as I looked the author <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._A._Harbinson">W.A. Harbinson</a> up yesterday and discovered that he&rsquo;s from Northern Ireland and now lives in West Cork!!! He&rsquo;s <del datetime="2012-02-12T12:34:51+00:00">82</del> 70 years old and I think he deserves a resurgence.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll never get a paper copy of the book now but brilliantly, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/GENESIS-ebook/dp/B004LLIF92/ref=tmm_kin_title_0?ie=UTF8&amp;m=AG56TWVU5XWC2">you can get it on Kindle</a>. It&rsquo;s only $4. Trust me, you&rsquo;ll love it, even if you hate it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also thought for 30 years that it would make an amazing movie. Go on, someone, do it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;
UPDATE: W.A. Harbinson has left a comment below, which was a lovely surprise on a Saturday night. He also linked <a href="http://www.waharbinson.eu.com/">to his own site</a> which I was not aware of. It has info on some of his more recent books too, which are avalable as downloads.</p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;Roku + Netflix + iPlayer now available in Ireland. Anyone using Roksbox or roConnect?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.theverge.com/hd/2012/2/10/2789042/roku-players-bbc-iplayer-uk-ireland?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">Verge is reporting</a> that the Roku LT and Roku 2 XS are now <a href="http://www.roku.com/uk?sflang=en">shipping in UK and Ireland</a>. They both come with Netflix and BBC iPlayer support. (Oddly their UK site still says &ldquo;Coming Soon&rdquo; for the LT).</p>

<p>The LT is particularly interesting as it is only 49despite the lack of wired Ethernet or 1080p.But both models suffer the major and strange limitation that they cannot stream your home content, even over UPNP.</p>

<p>However I have found two free apps, <a href="http://roksbox.com/home/">Roksbox</a> and <a href="http://www.ro-connect.com/download/download.php">roConnect</a> which create a private Roku channel for you which gives you access to your home media. Neither of them are UPNP either, they require you to install a web-server on a home machine. Having said that, it looks like a five minute job.</p>

<p>Anyone have experience with either app?</p>

<p>I have to admit I&rsquo;m tempted by the Roku. 49 is very very cheap for a media streamer that does 720p.</p>

<p>I got the <a href="http://www.patriotmemory.com/products/detailp.jsp?prodline=6&amp;catid=69&amp;prodgroupid=159&amp;id=895">Patriot PBO Core</a> from Amazon UK this week to replace a dead XBOX+XBMC and I&rsquo;ll review it over the weekend. It is a fine piece of kit for local streaming up to 1080p and does SMB shares rather than the UPNP horror. I&rsquo;m not sure why I mentioned 1080p since it is connected to a 12 year old 14&rdquo; CRT Philips &lsquo;portable&rsquo; TV.</p>

<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t do Netflix except via TVersity or PlayOn. And both of those are currently broken for Netflix Ireland+UK due to the silly incompatible way Netflix has implemented everything over here.</p>

<p>One open question is whether you need a global iPlayer subscription to use it in Ireland on the Roku. I assume so.</p>

<p>I saw a tweet along those lines the other day (sorry can&rsquo;t remember who) and it really struck a chord. These &ldquo;please install our App&rdquo; pop-ups are infuriating in general on both Android and iOS. Every single vbulletin site I have gone to recently has done it. Why the hell would I want a separate App for every damned site I visit?</p>

<p>But yesterday was the new nadir with Dropbox. Not only do you get the pop-up, they won&rsquo;t let you visit information/download pages for any other platform on the iPad, they just auto-re-direct you to the iPad page!!</p>

<p>For fucks sake Dropbox, I wanted to read what was involved in installing on a Linux server. Do I really need to use a desktop to read that page?</p>

<p>This finally revealed a very good reason for jailbreaking your iPad - you get a User-Agent Switcher and can pretend you are running Firefox on the Desktop. Also handy for those stupid sites who want to force a dumbed-down mobile web-site on you.</p>

<p>Piss-poor reduced functionality Apps are the scourge of iOS and Android. Last weekend I ended up uninstalling the iPad Facebook App and now use the website in Safari just so I can have a goddammed Share button.</p>

<p>I attended the first London Twitter Teatime back in October. It was an organisational disaster but an absolute must-not-miss. We were in a big room with not just some key Twitter technical people but also with many of the key third party developers in the UK including the <a href="http://www.datasift.com">DataSift</a> and <a href="http://www.peerindex.com">PeerIndex</a> guys.</p>

<p>The Q&amp;A session was particularly good with no-one being too shy about asking the hard questions (<em>cough</em> Twitter Annotations).</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/twitterapi"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-553" title="twitterapi" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/twitterapi.png" alt="" width="823" height="147" /></a></p>

<p>Big congrats to Donal Cahalane and the guys here for announcing <a href="http://www.web2ireland.org/2012/02/06/twitter-teatime-dublin/">Twitter Dublin Teatime</a>. If there is one thing you can be sure of with Donal involved, the event will kick ass.</p>

<p>Given the burst of activity around Twitter here in the past 24 months, there are going to be some amazing people to talk to on the night.</p>

<p>All details over on <a href="http://www.web2ireland.org/2012/02/06/twitter-teatime-dublin/">Web2Ireland.org</a> and sign-up on <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/form/dublin-teatime">Twitter</a>. Numbers are limited, and given that London was jammed, I&rsquo;d sign-up right now if I was you.</p>

<p>See ya there.</p>

<p>A few weeks back, Leonard Cohen&rsquo;s new album was pre-announced and I went to the &ldquo;<a href="http://www.myplaydirect.com/leonard-cohen/">Leonard Cohen Global Store</a>&rdquo; to buy it. They had a special offer of an extra free track available for download immediatelyif you pre-ordered the MP3s. Which I duly did.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, I couldn&rsquo;t find a link to download the free track anywhere but I wasn&rsquo;t that bothered and waited for the album to be released.</p>

<p>I was very disappointed to realise that the Global Store is just a front for Sony Music. So unlike Louis CK, Lenny is only getting a tiny fraction of the money I paid. Given his hugeglobalfan-base I hope he switches to the direct model for the next album and makes the money he is due.</p>

<p>Finally on Monday the album was released and I was sent a link.</p>

<p>The link let me download the free track. No amount of clicking would show me the album. This was followed by to-and-froing of emails with Sony where they were straight-up about the fact that the store was broken. Eventually I was sent a link to this:</p>

<p><a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/sonymusic.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-549" title="sonymusic" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/sonymusic.png" alt="" width="673" height="532" /></a></p>

<p>Yep, I had to click one song at a time. Also, check out the fantastic layout in Chrome. I was surprised I didn&rsquo;t see a &ldquo;Best viewed in Internet Explorer 5 or Netscape Navigator 2.0&rdquo; in the footer.</p>

<p>So it took a week to download something legally or I could have spent 2 minutes being naughty. Actually the ideal for everyone would be that I pay the money and then I go to adodgysite to get what I need.</p>

<p>Sony, EMI and the other dinosaurs need to spend less money hiring lawyers and more money hiring developers, UX designers and people who understand 21st century business models. Otherwise they will be gone the way of the East India Company in the next 3 years. Tick tock.</p>
