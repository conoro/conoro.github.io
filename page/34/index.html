                        <p>#&ldquo;Quick Call Cost Comparison of Eircom, Skype, Blueface, Google Voice and Rebtel&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>We run all of our business phone comms on Blueface (Irish number), Skype (UK number) and Google Voice (US Number). I was doing some checking on dial-out pricing on those services and others over the weekend and collected this initial pricing comparison. Thought it might be useful. Note that these are all Pay As You Go prices, except Eircom which is the home Talktime Chatter package. Most of them offer big discounts if you pay a monthly sub.</p>
<p />
<div>All prices in Euro Cent, per minute, daytime rate, including VAT where applicable.</div>
<p />
<div><strong>National Landlines</strong></div>
<div><span style="font-family: courier new, monospace;">Eircom &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 8.57</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: courier new, monospace;">Blueface &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1.9</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: courier new, monospace;">Skype &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2.2</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: courier new, monospace;">Google Voice &nbsp; &nbsp; 1.4</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: courier new, monospace;">Rebtel &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1.5</span></div>
<p />
<div><strong>Mobiles</strong><br />
<div>
<div><span style="font-family: courier new, monospace;">Eircom &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 21.91</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: courier new, monospace;">Blueface &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 18</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: courier new, monospace;">Skype &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;20.1</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: courier new, monospace;">Google Voice &nbsp; &nbsp; 14</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: courier new, monospace;">Rebtel &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 14.7</span></div>
</div>
<p />
<div>So bizarrely, Google Voice, a service which is not officially available in Ireland, is the cheapest of the lot with <a href="http://www.rebtel.com/">Rebtel</a> running them a very close second. &nbsp;If you had to pay VAT on GV, Rebtel wins. The Rebtel Android App is very impressive. I think I&rsquo;ll use them for calls this week. Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/johnpeavoy">John Peavoy</a> for the tip.</div>

                        <p>#&ldquo;Rolling Up My Sleeves to Build a Cross-Platform Mobile App with FeedHenry&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;ve been playing around with the <a href="http://developer.feedhenry.com">FeedHenry</a> platform for the past few months and it really has me excited with the&nbsp;<span style="font-size: small;">possibilities</span>. If you are not familiar with it, it&rsquo;s a platform for building iPhone/Android/Blackberry/WP7/Nokia-WRT mobile applications from one code-base using just HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are not just web-apps, they can be uploaded to the various App Stores too.</p>
<p>Pause for disclosure: I have done some work for the guys so feel free to treat my opinions accordingly.</p>
<p>There are several different ways of skinning the multi-platform cat and after all my study, FeedHenry is my preferred one. As they build everything in the cloud for you, you don&rsquo;t need to have 5 SDKs installed on your computer. Just upload and/or edit code in their online Studio, click Build and you are done.</p>
<p>On the handset side, you build your Apps using all the same HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript skills you learned doing normal web-apps. You then use the FeedHenry JavaScript APIs to access things like camera, GPS, local storage etc. The same calls are used no matter what handset you are on. You can use any UI library you like too. Raw HTML, JQuery Mobile and Sencha Touch are the three main ones. If you have other JS libraries, you can pull those in too.</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s all it did, I&rsquo;d still be interested because I will never sit down and learn iOS development or BB but if I can use general web skills to build Apps for those platforms, that&rsquo;s a huge win for me. But FeedHenry also has a Server-Side and that&rsquo;s where it gets very cool. You can write Server code in JavaScript too and they provide APIs for the handset to access that functionality. Now you can do all the heavy lifting and Web Services integrations on the Server and then just shoot over the information the handset needs. Your apps become far more lightweight, the battery usage is improved and you can use things like SQL or NoSQL databases on the Server.</p>

<img alt="Fh_for_posterous" height="375" src="http://getfile6.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/temp-2011-07-17/BxvpapahdyxrarpAEABBfiyywqgCabmlJnnhJDpGfJAIAdupzcBtefhtqFyw/fh_for_posterous.jpg.scaled500.jpg" width="500" />
</div>
</p>
<p>Remember, we&rsquo;re still talking the same skillset you used to build your last &ldquo;full size&rdquo; web-app. How flippin cool is that? Suddenly, when customers ask for an iPhone App for the web-app you built, you don&rsquo;t have to suck air in through your teeth and mention months of work.</p>
<p>The most recent upgrade on FeedHenry was actually the prompt for me to write this post. I have become a <a href="http://www.github.com/">GitHub</a> fanatic. Whilst Git itself is fine as a version control system, I&rsquo;m just in awe of the service that GitHub has layered on top of it. The notification system is amazing - I get a GTalk IM the second any developer does a commit on our repos. FeedHenry has now integrated GitHub into the build flow. So you can use your normal development toolset and work away on GitHub. When you are ready to build your Apps, just login to FeedHenry, give it the GitHub URL and bada-bing, your Apps are generated.</p>
<p>Thennnnnn, I got even more excited because I discovered the fabulousness of the <a href="http://cloud9ide.com/">Cloud 9 IDE</a>. A browser-based full-blown development IDE with GitHub integration! So I can work away in that IDE, committing my changes and then generate the Apps in FeedHenry. Full end-to-end Cross-Platform mobile App development without a single thing having to be installed on my PC.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said it many times before, but if someone is looking for an area to up-skill in, I think it has to be in mobile and it has to be in hard-core JavaScript development.</p>
<p>I have four projects at the minute which will be built in FeedHenry. Three itch-scratchers and one pretty serious-assed. I&rsquo;ll report back on them (and pimp them) as soon as they are ready.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;So I got a new laptop. That&rsquo;s probably the last time I&rsquo;ll ever mention it&rdquo;</p>

<p>Laptops for me are like desktops, phones and screwdrivers. They are tools, not an expression of who I am as a person or what lifestyle I aspire to. <p /><div>I got my last proper one four years ago. It&#39;s still going strong and still as dog slow as the day I bought it, second-hand, on eBay. It was a Dell D420 which I have been juggling with a 120 quid Acer Netbook for the past few years. Whilst the portability was always great, the lack of welly and memory had become insufferable over the past year. Maxing it to 1.5GB RAM, using an SSD and switching to Ubuntu didn&#39;t help that much. Open 20 Chrome Tabs (or 1 Firefox Tab) and it was pretty much out of memory.</div> <p /><div>So I finally decided to go back down the desktop-replacement route like my ancient and still functional Acer Aspire 2026 which did Le Web 2006 with me.</div><p /><div>There is phenomenal value to be had right now around the 400 Euro mark with decent machines sporting 15.6&quot; screens, i3 dual-core CPUs and a few gigs of RAM. But if this machine was to last me another 4 years I had to go higher spec. Strangely that turned out to be quite difficult.</div> <p /><div>Obviously I&#39;m not going to spend silly money on an MBP, so I looked at the usual suspects of Acer, Asus, Samsung, Dell, HP etc. I&#39;ve been disappointed with Dell every time I&#39;ve gone to spec a machine for anyone in the past few years. As soon as you add any desirable feature, the price goes through the roof. So the 15z and its light brother dropped out of the race pretty quickly. With most of the other brands, the selection dropped to almost nothing once I specified an i7 CPU. The one exception was Asus on the <a href="http://Komplett.ie">Komplett.ie</a> site which had every possible combination of CPU/Memory/Screen you could possibly ask for.</div> <p /><div>It turns out that my ideal spec is actually a gaming PC spec. The last desktop game I played regularly was Quake so I don&#39;t really fit the demographic but what the hell, if the machines meed my needs, I&#39;m happy.</div> <p /><div>After a bunch of to&#39;ing and fro&#39;ing and spec reading and review reading and YouTube watching I decided that the <a href="http://komplett.ie/Komplett/product/ZKB_02PC/02_NOTEBOO/05_NOTEBOO/productdetails/80001914/Asus_15_6__N53SN_SZ139V_i7_2630_6_640_GB/90N4PA219H4457VL133Y/default.aspx">Asus N53S Series</a>(<a href="http://www.asus.com/Notebooks/Multimedia_Entertainment/N53SN">Asus Site Link</a>) was the one for me. The spec is as follows:</div> <ul><li>Asus 15,6&quot; N53SN-SZ139V</li><li>Full HD 1920 x 1080 - LED Backlit</li><li>2.0 Mega Pixel Webcam</li><li>Sandybridge Intel Core i7 2630QM - 2,0GHz - Can spike to 3.0GHz. Quad core, 8 threads.</li><li>6 GB DDR3 RAM</li> <li>640 GB 5400rpm HDD</li><li>Dual Layer DVDReWriter</li><li>NVIDIA GeForce GT 550 Graphics - 2 GB. Auto-switches to more battery-friendly IntelGraphicswhen not needed.</li><li>Bang &amp; Olufsen Speakers</li><li>Gigabit Ethernet, 802.11b/g/n wireless</li> <li>Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit</li><li>2x USB 2.0, RJ45 LAN, HDMI, Mic-in jack, Headphone jack out, VGA Port/MINI D-sub, 3-in-1 card-reader (SD, MMC, MS)</li><li>1x USB 3.0</li></ul><p /><div>Things I love:</div> <div><ul><li>Jesus it&#39;s fast. I think it may be faster than my desktop</li><li>Full HD screen is stunning</li><li>Speakers are very loud and have plenty of bass</li><li>HDMI-out in case I need to plug into TV</li><li> USB 3,.0 gives me some future-proofing</li><li>It feels solid like it&#39;s going to last the expected 4 years.</li><li>It just works</li></ul></div><p /><div>Things I don&#39;t love:</div><div><ul><li>US Layout keyboard which causes character mapping grief when I have UK external keyboard plugged in</li> <li>Keyboard itself is a littlespongy</li><li>I suspect the 2GB of video RAM is taken from the 6GB of main RAM (TBC)</li><li>DVI or Displayport would have been nice</li><li>It&#39;s bloody huge. My rucksack isn&#39;t big enough to take it. So new bag will have to be bought</li> <li>It came with a Dutch version of that stripped down MS Office (sort that, Komplett!)</li><li>It was riddled with pre-installed bloatware, all of which I deleted</li><li>It had a weird partitioning of the HDD (which was easy to change)</li> </ul><div>So overall I&#39;m happy as a pig in shite and I&#39;d strongly recommend it if you need something able to run VMware or other resource-sucking apps. Actually, as it doesn&#39;t need an external screen,for most people it would easily do double duty as a laptop and their main desktop.</div> </div></p>

<p>Pretty much every time I bring up Skype, I get one of these massive overlay ads. This is despite me saying I don&#39;t want to see ads and, more importantly, the fact that I&#39;m a paying customer. This is customer abuse, plain and simple.</p><p /><div>Luckily I found a solution on one of the Skype forums.<div><ol><li>In Skype, go to Tools &gt; Change Language &gt; Edit Skype Language File&hellip; &gt; Save as&hellip;</li><li>Save default English as &quot;SkypeEnglish.lang&quot;</li> <li>If Windows can&#39;t save it in Skype dir, just let it save in your User Dir</li><li>Edit that file in a text editor</li><li>Change s_LANGUAGE_NAME=English to s_LANGUAGE_NAME=DieSkypeAdsDie in that file</li><li>Save it</li> <li>Back in Skype, go to Tools &gt; Change Language &gt; Load Skype Language File&hellip; &gt; &quot;SkypeEnglish.lang&quot;</li><li>In Tools &gt; Change Language, you should see Language Set to &quot;DieSkypeAdsDie (user-defined)&quot;</li> </ol><div>The reason this works is because Skype targets ads based on Language. It doesn&#39;t have any ads for the DieSkypeAdsDie Language so it doesn&#39;t show any.</div></div></div><p /><div>A better solution would be for Skype not to abuse their paying customers with relentless repetitive in-your-face ads like this.</div></p>

<p><div>My Skype says 26m people connected right now.</div><p />Skype says that 300m video chat minutes are used every month.<p /><div>So 10m minutes a day.</div><p /><div>So 7,000 people every minute out of the 26m connected. i.e. a maximum of 3,500 chats.<p /><div>Sounds about right. i.e. bugger all. <p /></div></div><div>What is this bubble obsession with video chat apart from small kids and their parents/grand-parents when they are away?</div><p /><div>Iridium phone anyone?</div><p /><div> Or has my pounding-headache-addled brain done the maths wrong?</div></p>

 <p>Love that remote. Hate the generic Chinese eBay MCE one that we use at the moment. I assume it'll also work with XBMC?
</p><p>$50 is a bit steep tho.
</p><p>Now we just have to wait for Boxee to be stable on Ubuntu again. Roll on Autumn.</p></div>

<p>Last night I did a clean install of Ubuntu 11.04 in VMware Player on my Windows 7 machine. I love the Easy-Install feature which makes this an unattended piece of cake. But I was perplexed to find that the new Ubuntu Unity Desktop was missing. Eventually I sussed that it doesn&#39;t work (yet) in Player. But in my search I kept finding references to another &quot;Unity&quot; in VMware so I had to see what it was.</p><p /><div>And OMG it&#39;s awesome. When you turn on Unity in VMware Player, you can launch any of your Virtual Machine&#39;s Apps inside native windows on Windows! So GEdit, XEmacs, SSH tunnels to RDS, Terminal, anything you like. You get an extra launcher above your Windows Start Button to access any of those Linux Apps. <p /><div>I used to do something similar to this back in the 90s where I&#39;d run a Linux box in the lab and run X-Windows software on the PC which allowed me to display remote windows. But generally it was slow, buggy and crashed a lot. This Unity setup means I can now pretty much forget about needing a dedicated Linux Laptop/PC or even dual boot. I now have the best of both worlds on the one desktop.</div> <p /><div>Next step is to see if VMware Player can access remote VMs on other machines like I used to do with ESX server etc.</div><p /><p /><p /></div></p>
