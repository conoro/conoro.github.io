                        <p>This time it&rsquo;s more about software than hardware. But first, hardware.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lightning</strong>: We had a lightning strike near our home a few weeks back and my main Windows desktop has been acting dodgy ever since. I swapped the PSU but that didn&rsquo;t help and finally came to the conclusion that some of the USB ports were damaged on the motherboard. One replacement Gigabyte 970A-DS3P later and all seems to be well. I also replaced an older hard-disk that sounded like a machine-gun since day 1 with a combo one that has a small amount of SSD. The silence is a joy.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Node.js</strong>: I built a small mini stats portal for a side-project in Node.js with a bit of Bootstrap, Google Charts and Passport. I still believe that a lot of Node&rsquo;s power comes from the ecosystem and community. There are just so many good tutorials and sample applications out there that you can always find a good starting point. For example <a href="http://scottksmith.com/blog/2014/10/05/twitatron-building-a-production-web-app-with-node/">this one</a>. This also means that you have the combined knowledge of a ton of people who have sorted out nasties like CSRF, CORS, Auth, etc. already. Everything I&rsquo;ve done has been based on Express and MongoDB but <a href="http://hapijs.com/">HAPI</a> is starting to get that community energy too. My first failed attempt at that portal was in Go, which leads nicely to&hellip;.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Go</strong>: I&rsquo;ve also been playing around with <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> (#golang) which is a very interesting language built by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, Ken Thompson and others in Google. Anyone who knows C will feel very comfortable with it. It&rsquo;s like C with all the badness removed. I took to it like a duck to water and found it extremely easy to learn and become productive with. It&rsquo;s designed as a language for server apps and my first real app was a re-write of a database maintenance tool that started in Python, moved to Node.js and is now running perfectly in Go. The whole workflow around Go is a real strength and I can see why it&rsquo;s gaining a lot of traction in the past 24 months with companies like Bitly, Docker, Apcera etc. Its two main weaknesses are not language related. First is the small size of the community - you cannot &ldquo;program via Stack Overflow&rdquo; the way you can with Node, there just isn&rsquo;t the volume of information out there. Second is the state of Go web frameworks - there seems to be a strong anti-framework mindset in the community which thinks everyone should build from first principles. That&rsquo;s fine for full-time hardcore developers but it puts off tinkerers like me who find frameworks a nice entry point into a language. So whilst full-stack frameworks like <a href="http://beego.me/">Beego</a> have great potential (as do smaller ones like <a href="http://revel.github.io/">Revel</a> etc), the number of developers is tiny and once again you are back to the community-size and availability of learning-material problem. So for the moment I&rsquo;m going to focus on using it for tools, utilities and some fun stuff on the Raspberry Pi. Actually, the fact that it works seamlessly across Windows, OSX, Linux and generates static binaries for them is one of the other reasons I like it so much. If you have an hour, watch Rob Pike&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoS7DsT1rdM">wonderful keynote at GopherCon</a> in April where he deconstructs hello world.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Re-factoring</strong>: A major mistake I made back in 2008 was taking a short-cut and telling a developer to build a start-upâ€™s Admin back-end on top of Django Admin. Initially it made lots of sense when most of the functionality was just interacting with the models, but as soon as you try to do anything new, you realise you have to do it as a bloody mishmash of hacks, workarounds and copy/pasted code. In a way I&rsquo;m contradicting the previous point I made about Go but actually the error was more about not biting the bullet and re-implementing the Admin from scratch in the early days, once the initial prototype had done its job. The question now is whether it would be worth someone&rsquo;s time, even as a multi-weekend/Christmas learning exercise, to re-do in Node and Express. The system actually started as a Turbogears application so this wouldn&rsquo;t be the first time to make such a move!</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Win8.1</strong>: Switched from Windows 7 to Windows 8.1. It&rsquo;s still getting in the way and slowing me down, but less so than Win 8.0. The driver-signing nonsense is still infuriating, as is the method of turning that off. However I did learn the WinKey-X short-cut which gives you quick access to everything you need like Control Panel, Command Prompt and Shut-down menu.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Harp.js</strong>: This static blog you are reading is hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> and generated by <a href="http://harpjs.com/">Harp.js</a>. I&rsquo;m still a big fan of Harp and I&rsquo;m thrilled it now works end-to-end on Windows. Just install Node.js and do npm install -g harp. I used to have a plethora of WordPress sites and blogs but after the relentless hacks of <sup>2013</sup>&frasl;<sub>2014</sub>, I&rsquo;m done with it. I have two sites left to port over to being based on Harp.js and then it&rsquo;s buh-bye WordPress/PHP/MySQL/Insert-name-of-security-hole-riddled-plugin-here. We all moved to WordPress from Blogger/MT/etc for its ease of use and quick install but I think the move away will become a flood as people grow tired of the upgrade treadmill. The next major version of WordPress should be about security not just of the core but of every plugin too.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Inbox</strong>: Got an invite to Google Inbox. Once signed up, I spent my entire time worried I was missing an email or that I&rsquo;d accidentally archived it or trying to find the &ldquo;Mark as Unread&rdquo; button in Chrome. Sorry Google, but my first 5 minutes on GMail were a complete joy back in the day, whilst Inbox was an exercise is &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the actual point here, apart from being different?&rdquo;.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>IRC</strong>: It&rsquo;s huge in Red Hat. I really love using it. Could it have a resurgence or will it go the way of Usenet? I&rsquo;m using <a href="http://hexchat.github.io/">HexChat</a> on Windows which is rather good. I think the mIRC UI is what kept me away for all those years.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Linux</strong>: I&rsquo;m moving from Ubuntu/Lubuntu/Mint in all my VirtualBox VMs to CentOS 7 and Fedora 20. Apart from yum instead of apt-get, there really isn&rsquo;t that much difference for normal day-to-day stuff. I can install all the usual tools and work as I did previously. The lack of window minimise/maximise/close buttons on Fedora is completely ridiculous tho.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a></strong>: Cos, SEO :-) But srsly, I&rsquo;ve been kicking off some Docker instances of Mongo and Node apps inside a VBox VM and liking it a lot. Setting up the inter-instance networking is a bit of a pain tho. One thing that bothers me is the initial promise of tiny images seems to have fallen by the wayside. You really should avoid playing with it on home broadband if your base OS is different to the base OS used to build the image you want to play with. Also be very specific about what version of something you want or it&rsquo;ll download all available versions.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>OpenShift</strong>: Doing a bit of playing with Red Hat&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.openshift.com/products/online">OpenShift</a> PaaS. So far so good but I haven&rsquo;t gone much further than Node.js hello world.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>GoRead</strong>: Discovered a brilliant RSS reader a few months ago called <a href="https://www.goread.io/">GoRead</a> that looks and acts a lot like good old Google Reader. This one is written in Go and you have to self-host. But I was thrilled to find that I can host it on Google App Engine on the free tier. I&rsquo;ve stopped using all the centralised readers like Feedly since.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Bitbucket</strong>: I don&rsquo;t think many people realise that <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">BitBucket</a> has most of the same features as GitHub but provides private repos for free. Its only real flaws are the lack of a GitHub Pages equivalent and the lack of 2 Factor Authentication (which is really unforgivable at this stage.)</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Pinboard</strong>: I finally dumped Delicious a few months back and paid the tiny few quid to get a <a href="https://pinboard.in/u:conoro">Pinboard</a> account. Not only is it a great bookmarking service that just works (and works quickly), the guy who runs it has one of the <a href="https://twitter.com/pinboard">best Twitter accounts</a> out there. It was able to import all of my Delicious bookmarks and the IFTTT  and Twitter integrations means that all my tweeted links, re-tweets and favourites automatically get saved as bookmarks.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><a href="http://janetter.net/">Janetter</a></strong>: It&rsquo;s still the best Tweetdeck-multi-column-style Twitter client on Windows and OSX (but not brilliant on Android). The word/user filters alone would cause me to pay many many Euro for it but the regex filters make it invaluable.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>More tomorrow.</p>

                        <p>Once you get out of the habit of blogging it can take ages to get back in the zone. A week&rsquo;s vacation this week should do the trick for me. This is partially a link dump and partially the subjects of a bunch of upcoming posts.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.feedhenry.com/red-hat-to-acquire-feedhenry/">Red Hat acquired FeedHenry</a>. I first installed Linux in 2006 when working in San Jose and was a Red Hat user all through those early years and into the initial Fedora years. I launched a start-up on 2 CentOS servers. After a period in the Ubuntu wilderness, it feels like I&rsquo;m coming home :-)</p></li>

<li><p>Bought a <a href="http://robosavvy.com/store/product_info.php/cPath/2050/products_id/4603">Printrbot Simple</a> - One of the cheapest 3d printers you can buy. Took me a lazy weekend to assemble. Still freaks me out that I can print plastic. Not using it as much as I&rsquo;d expected as I need to up-skill in CAD first but love being able to print STL files off the web on a whim. Print quality not amazing but for â‚¬400, I can&rsquo;t complain. Lots more posts coming on this. I&rsquo;ll probably be upgrading from the fishing line to proper belts and pulleys soon.</p></li>

<li><p>Bought a <a href="http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/DSO-Nano-v3-p-1358.html">DSO Nano oscilloscope</a> - When I walked out of UCD in 1992 I swore I&rsquo;d never touch an oscilloscope again as long as I lived. Far too many afternoons spent doing elec labs with those horrible unusable things. Turns out they are dead handy when you can&rsquo;t figure something out from software! Have decided to sit down and <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-an-oscilloscope">learn how to use it properly</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>Bought a <a href="http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/Bus-Pirate-v36-universal-serial-interface-p-609.html">Bus Pirate</a> - This is a cool mini &ldquo;logic analyser&rdquo; that understands many common protocols like I2C, MIDI, SPI. I seem to spend inordinate amounts of time getting I2C and SPI working on my projects. This should finally help me figure out the nRF24L01 issues.</p></li>

<li><p>Have been getting frustrated with most Arduinos being 5V whilst most modules nowadays are 3.3V. Level shifters are a pain. So I got some <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardProMini">3.3V 8MHz Pro Minis</a> to deal with this. Two days of grief trying to get them working with one module before I finally figured out that they cannot do 115200 serial comms reliably. Grr.</p></li>

<li><p>The <a href="http://www.electrodragon.com/product/esp8266-wi07c-wifi-module/">ESP8266</a> is a stunning piece of kit. It&rsquo;s a full Wi-Fi module and TCPIP stack on a tiny board for only $4.50. It works over a serial connection and can Wifi-enable the most basic of Arduinos. It has been a bit of a pain to get going with it since there are tons of conflicting blogposts out there about them. I&rsquo;m sure the stability will improve over time as the Open Source community focuses a lot of their attention on them. One important note is that they use a lot of power and you&rsquo;ll struggle to power them from a pin on an Arduino. This also means that long-term battery-powered operation is a no-no.</p></li>

<li><p>The <a href="http://www.elecfreaks.com/store/unofficial-version-google-cardboard-p-773.html">Google Cardboard clones</a> I&rsquo;ve been getting from China are head-wreckers. It should not be this easy to give people a sense of Oculus Rift style VR. Sure they don&rsquo;t compare with Oculus but it&rsquo;s one of the first times I&rsquo;ve seen the kids blown away by a piece of tech. They just got it! For the sake of a tenner, you&rsquo;d be silly not to try it out. The Versailles demo and Google Earth are amazing. The simple roller-coaster is less so but you need to be sitting down!</p></li>

<li><p>The <a href="https://store.kliidje.com/index.php/security-key.html">Plug-up security key</a> for 2 Factor Authentication is interesting. It&rsquo;s a cheap USB key that implements the FIDO U2F standard and gives you another way of authenticating for GMail (on Chrome only so far). I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ll keep using it but it&rsquo;s a damn sight quicker to use that the bloody Authenticator app on your phone.</p></li>

<li><p>I finally got a proper soldering station. From 1984-2012 I used the one from my youth. Then two years with a crappy Draper iron from a local hardware shop with some usage of the â‚¬10 Lidl one. This <a href="http://www.aoyue.eu/aoyue-int937-soldering-station-smd-soldering-iron-esd-safe.html">Aoyue Int937</a> is a good quality Chinese clone of an older Hakko design. So far I&rsquo;m finding it extremely good. Even the reduction in waiting time from 5mins+ to 30 secs for it to heat up makes it worth it. German supplier sent to Ireland for â‚¬65 incl delivery.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://www.eircom.net/efibreinfo/map">eFibre</a> is now available in Old Chapel, Bandon. You have no idea how big a deal this is for me. We&rsquo;ve been stuck on 6Mbs/384kbs for what feels like a decade. Things like backups, Dropbox, Webinars, Netflix etc etc have been torture. All our kids are intimately familiar with &ldquo;buffering&rdquo;. Given the closeness of the VDSL cabinet, we&rsquo;re hoping for the full 90Mbs. Fingers crossed.</p></li>

<li><p>The <a href="http://www.exp-tech.de/Shields/Wireless/Bluetooth/redbearlab-ble-nano-mk20-usb-board.html">Red Bear BLE Nano Kit</a> is a superb way of getting into BLE, iBeacons etc. I&rsquo;m playing around with one for the <a href="https://github.com/google/physical-web/blob/master/documentation/getting_started.md">Google Physical Web</a> initiative. The idea is that every beacon just advertises a URL instead of some Apple-mandated/or-random UUID. So simple but actually quite profound. I got the kit from Exp Tech in Germany and they seem to be good value for electronics in general. â‚¬7 postage to Ireland for most things with advantage of Eurozone and speed of delivery.</p></li>

<li><p>Speaking of the Red Bear kit, this is also my first experience of the ARM mbed online development studio. Wow, love it! It generates the binary and you download in the browser but the really impressive bit is that you drop the binary on the pseudo memory stick that the module presents to Windows and it auto-installs and runs the binary for you. So so so much better and slicker than the poxy USB-Serial messing on Arduino.</p></li>

<li><p>I haven&rsquo;t been able to get the cheap <a href="http://www.aliexpress.com/store/915658">HM-10 BLE module</a> to work with Google Physical Web. The <a href="http://jnhuamao.cn/">Chinese manufacturer</a> sent me a one line &ldquo;just do X&rdquo; without explaining how, in response to my query. So I may have to give up on it and only use it as an iBeacon.</p></li>

<li><p>Halloween is coming on Friday. Projects under-way. Less ambitious than before but should have some pics up on Saturday :-)</p></li>

<li><p>I was disappointed that my 13 year old Mondeo uses a version of CAN bus that is incompatible with the fun <a href="http://www.dx.com/p/elm327-obd-bluetooth-diagnostic-interface-black-130325#.VFDV4fmsUwM">OBD-II bluetooth modules</a> that you can get for half-nothing online. If yours is newer, you can plug it in just under your right knee. However it worked beautifully on my wife&rsquo;s 10 year old Zafira. You have to remove the panel underneath the handbrake. The app you use on your Android phone is called Torque. It&rsquo;s really impressive to see all of your engine stats appearing on your phone. I&rsquo;d love to see us return to the old days where everyone was able to fix their own cars. I used to do a lot of the maintenance on my old Citroens (because, ye know, they&rsquo;re Citroens) but never touched the Mondeo until recently. I&rsquo;ve replaced both the coil pack and all the brake-pads myself but I&rsquo;d love to have been able to use the OBD-II to analyse the engine.</p></li>

<li><p>The power of APIs - Just had a request this morning from someone who wants to make use of an API I launched in 2008. It had some updates in 2009 but hasn&rsquo;t been changed since then. It still works perfectly and is at the heart of a bunch of features and tooling/automation. I&rsquo;ve been saying it for years but you should do everything API-first. You should read <a href="http://apievangelist.com/">API Evangelist</a> regularly, he has this stuff nailed.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>OK, I&rsquo;ll probably do another batch of these tomorrow. For the moment, it&rsquo;s time to tie together a bunch of things I&rsquo;ve been playing with since 2012.</p>

                        <p>I have long bemoaned Lego&rsquo;s approach to adding electronics/power to their kits. Technics seems to be its own little sub-section and Mindstorms is a crazy waste of money in an Arduino and Raspberry Pi world. Now that they are the biggest toy company globally, I&rsquo;d love to see how either of those product ranges are adding to the bottom line.</p>

<p>In that spirit I was very excited about the possibilities of the Lego Batman kit I got in Hamley&rsquo;s recently. After beating back the sales people who tried to sell me blue or white Batmen (are they completely insane?), I finally found a proper black one from the movie.</p>

</p>

<p>On Saturday, I started assembly with my two daughters and a small bit of help/interest from one of the boys. When I say &ldquo;I started assembly&rdquo;, I really mean I handed the pieces to the girls who then clicked them into place with zero delay and almost no reference to the instructions. Their spatial reasoning seems to be at 1000x the speed of mine.</p>

<p>We were thrilled with the result but I have bigger plans for this helicopter. Phase one was the motor for the rotor. I have a bunch of a rumble motors from broken original XBOX controllers and it was a trivial task to hotglue on a piece of metal to connect it to the rotor.</p>

<p>I tried to zip tie the motor to the helicopter but then the general solution dawned on me: I should be hotgluing these add-ons to pieces of lego and then it becomes a simple exercise to add/remove them from kits, depending on the mood you are in.</p>

<p>This worked like a charm and all of the kids were suitably impressed. Here it is in action. Watch those fingers!</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll switch to a LiPo battery and smaller switch and wiring later in the week. The kids have also suggested the next set of improvements which we&rsquo;ll do next weekend. Yes of course it involves LEDs.</p>

                    <div class="post-description">
                        <p>Back in 2011, I <a href="http://conoroneill.com/2011/11/17/bandon-flood-fews-open-data-now-available/">created a simple scraper</a> in Python to take the river level reported by the Bandon Flood Early Warning System every 15 minutes and save it in <a href="https://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?docid=103YIcARoxuaWT7NfZ8mVBzY554sF_3ONYC1N3DE">Google Fusion Tables</a>. In 2012, <a href="http://conoroneill.net/bandon-flood-data-fews-now-available-on-cosmpachube/">I extended it</a> to also save the data on <a href="https://xively.com/feeds/40004/?from_cosm=true">Pachube/Cosm/Xively/Fleeglrheumazoid</a> (or whatever insane name they have this week). So you have 2.5 years of river data in tabular and graphic form.</p>

<p>The code itself is very simple and just involved walking through the page (actually a bloody iframe!) to get the element I needed. But it&rsquo;s brittle, single use and runs on a home server behind the firewall. I also have a gap in the data in 2012 where I didn&rsquo;t notice that the cronjob had screwed up for 2 weeks.</p>

<p>Last week I heard about <a href="https://www.kimonolabs.com/">Kimono</a> and really liked the sound of it. You basically point it at any web-page and it gives you a version of the page where you can select elements and get API end-points for them. So any site that has info you&rsquo;d like to use or open up but where there is no existing API, can be API-ified. You need no coding knowledge to do this.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/kimono.jpg" alt="Kimono" title="Web Scraping" />
</p>

<p>This has huge potential to generate even more Irish OpenData without relying on developers to do the work. Given how little data has been opened up here, either officially or by OpenData enthusiasts, this can only be a good thing.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;d like to access the Bandon River level programatically now, <a href="https://www.kimonolabs.com/apis/cr79egwi">it is here as JSON, CSV and RSS</a>.</p>

<p>As an exercise for the reader, why not try the truly hilarious <a href="http://maps.corkcoco.ie/planningenquiryv3/LAResources/info.aspx">Cork County Council Planning Enquiry System</a> which works best with Internet Explorer 5.5 or newer :-) Of course, the &ldquo;accept terms and conditions button&rdquo; does not work with Chrome. It looks like the same web gurus who designed Bandon FEWS also did this site, since both use 1990s-style frames, which Kimono does not handle at all. I just spent 2 mins playing with it and picked out the <a href="http://maps.corkcoco.ie/planningenquiryv3/enquiry.aspx">central frame</a>. But Kimono-ifying it gives a session timeout error by the CorkCoCo site. I think a small bit of effort could get this working. Any takers or do you all prefer to just talk about OpenData?</p>

                        <p>One small annoyance with the Baseline bolierplate in harp.js is that every blogpost needs to be listed in a file called _data.json with all the relevant metadata. Whilst it&rsquo;s not a huge job to slug-ify a title and add the ID and epoch time, it&rsquo;s sufficiently annoying to add friction to me blogging more. Here&rsquo;s the entry for this blogpost:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">
  &quot;a-simple-nodejs-script-to-setup-a-new-blog-post-in-harpjs&quot;: {
    &quot;ID&quot;: 1291,
    &quot;author&quot;: &quot;admin&quot;,
    &quot;date&quot;: 1403504847928,
    &quot;ptype&quot;: &quot;post&quot;,
    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;This little script generates the relevant metadata in the _data.json file including epoch time and optional Facebook thumbnail URL if you are using the Baseline boilerplate.&quot;,
    &quot;slug&quot;: &quot;a-simple-nodejs-script-to-setup-a-new-blog-post-in-harpjs&quot;,
    &quot;status&quot;: &quot;publish&quot;,
    &quot;title&quot;: &quot;A simple Node.js script to setup a new blog post in Harp.js&quot;,
    &quot;FBImage&quot;: &quot;https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/newpost.jpg&quot;
  }

</code></pre>

<p>This little script just generates everything you need once you tell it a title, description and image &ldquo;thumbnail&rdquo;. That latter piece is something I added to the _data.json &ldquo;schema&rdquo; so that when my posts are auto-shared to Facebook by dlvr.it, it&rsquo;s not the same image there every time but one of my chosing.</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">
// newpost.js
// Create all the metadata for a new Harp blogpost
// node newpost.js
// Uses and updates the _data.json file in your _harp directory

<p>Sourcecode <a href="https://github.com/conoro/conoro.github.io/blob/master/_harp/js/newpost.js">is on GitHub</a> as always.</p>

<p>One interesting side-note was how much effort it was to find a Node module that asks for user input in the way I needed. There are lots of modules out there for Q&amp;A and some of them make it very easy to ask lots of questions, but not one of them (not one!) is able to deal with input that stretches over more than the terminal width. All of them start overwriting what you write on the screen instead of scrolling up. That&rsquo;s a pretty staggering oversight by a lot of developers. Eventually I found the classic readline library which I have used in many languages over the years and it worked like a charm.</p>

<p>Usage:

<p>It uses your AWS credentials in ~/aws_config.json { &ldquo;accessKeyId&rdquo;: &ldquo;akid&rdquo;, &ldquo;secretAccessKey&rdquo;: &ldquo;secret&rdquo;, &ldquo;region&rdquo;: &ldquo;us-west-2&rdquo; }</p>

<p>So if I have a file called s3_upload.jpg on my Desktop and I invoke as follows:</p>
