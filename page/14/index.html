                        <p>#&ldquo;Standing Desk Update&rdquo;</p>

<p>My standing desk experiments have been intermittent but I&rsquo;ve put some renewed effort in recently due to some back twinges. I finally cleared out the tiny annex office off my main office and changed the standing desk over to my main laptop.</p>

<p><img class="alignnone" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-PHy7o9YZt-s/UFbu2t09wdI/AAAAAAAAi0M/ADd7EW7ZTQ4/s800/2012-09-17%25252009.58.27.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="800" /></p>

<p>Overall it works brilliantly and is more stable than the previous set of cardboard boxes :-) The floor mat is important to avoid getting sore heels. I either go barefoot or wear the Vibrams when standing.</p>

<p>The main lesson learned is that it&rsquo;s not something you should do 12 hours a day. Mix it up and make sure to keep moving, don&rsquo;t stay stationary for long periods. I generally take phone calls sitting down or when I have to read long technical documents. I think trying to read too much from a screen that is a few feet away whilst swaying slightly on your feet is just too hard.</p>

<p>Anyone else been trying it out? Any lessons learned you&rsquo;d like to share?</p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;How the hell did I miss the upcoming shutdown of FeedBurner? Another lesson in lock-in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>How the hell did I miss the fact that Google is shutting down FeedBurner in October?</p>

<p>I always remember Dave Winer <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2007/07/21/whyFeedburnerIsTrouble.html">warning all us bloggers</a> back in 2007 that we were nuts to insert a single company between us and our readers.Most of us thought he was being a crank. It turns out he was right.</p>

<p>My big worry is that we will all lose all of our Blog Subscribers. In my case, built up over 11 years. I&rsquo;ll be optimistic and assume some sort of skeleton FeedBurner service will exist which will 301 re-direct all the feeds to the original sources.</p>

<p>Great round-up piece on the problem by <a href="http://www.nevillehobson.com/2012/09/09/prepare-for-goodbye-feedburner-in-october-2012/">Neville Hobson</a>. Two solutions <a href="http://threads.scripting.com/8312ByDw/theFutureOfFeedburner">offered by Dave</a>.</p>

<p>How many times are we going to fall for this before we learn? We see a service that offers us some really nice benefits for free (FeedBurner, Facebook , Twitter, etc etc). Then we choose to ignore what will happen if they go away or change the rules or just break. We decide lock-in is a fair swap for free. Then they go away or change the rules or just break. And we&rsquo;re left high and dry, swearing never again. Until the next time.</p>

<p>Luckily I&rsquo;ve only got two blogs left using FeedBurner. Unluckily they are the two most trafficked. I&rsquo;ll see if I can do the CNAME transition before D-Day and report back.</p>

<p>UPDATE: Someone left a comment on Google+ saying that it is just specific APIs that are getting shutdown, not the overall service. If I can confirm that, I&rsquo;ll report back. Meanwhile, I&rsquo;m still going to make the CNAME move.</p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;Sugru + Old Mondeo = Yay&rdquo;</p>

<p>My ancient old Ford Mondeo (2001) is still going strong. In some ways I hate it for doing so. It&rsquo;s an appliance and I don&rsquo;t like appliances, I like things with character. Prior to it I only bought Citroens (BX, AX, Xantia) and I loved them dearly. But they were unreliable piles of junk assembled by drunks. Then, once we had kids, an appliance became necessary.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;New&rdquo; Mondeo was the second car in the renaissance of Ford. The first was the Focus in 1999. My wife had a Focus and it was as close to perfect a car as you could get. Interesting shapes inside and out, totally reliable and not a generic over-priced BMW. Her sister drove it for a few years after her and loved it too. The Mondeo kept the reliability of the Focus but was dead boring to look at, inside and out.</p>

<p>In 11 years, the only problems it has had are a badly designed handbrake and grab handles which pop out of the ceiling. It also loses the gas in the aircon too quickly and it needed a suspension joint replaced a few years ago. It gets one service a year across the road for 100+ and that&rsquo;s it.</p>

<p>120,000 miles later and it bombs up and down the M7/M8 like a new car.</p>

<p>But in all this time, one thing has bugged me every day. The dashboard has a stippled effect which is a magnet for dust but is also impossible to attach anything too. Particularly phone holders. So I&rsquo;ve always had to attach them to the windscreen. The problem there is that the angle of the screen is so severe, it is always awkward, in landscape-mode, far away and murdered by glare. In France, on holidays in July, the HTC Sensation overheated so badly using Google Maps Navigation that a 2 Amp charger couldn&rsquo;t keep the battery charged!</p>

<p>Then yesterday, 11 years later, I had a brainwave. Sugru:</p>

<p>And ye know what? It flippin works!</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s to another 120,000 miles.</p>

<p>If Facebook paid even a minutes notice to the intention graph rather than the social graph, they&rsquo;d see that I relentlessly click Hide on all mentions of games. Then maybe they could avoid wasting their valuable screen real-estate pimping something I will never ever ever click on.</p>

<p>I also had a look at some of the ads on FB today. Bloody hell, not a single solitary thing I&rsquo;m remotely interested in. Just because I&rsquo;m friends/family with someone on Facebook does not mean I share any of their interests. But when we talk about a movie/TV show/book/product, then you&rsquo;ve got some useful data.</p>

<p>Given the amount of Likes and Shares I do on Facebook, it really is shocking that they can&rsquo;t find one thing to recommend to me that I&rsquo;d actually buy. It doesn&rsquo;t surprise me at all that their Ad revenue has flattened out.</p>

<p>I really hope someone out there is working on an all new Ads system. I don&rsquo;t mind Ads, I really don&rsquo;t, but I haven&rsquo;t clicked on one in a very long time.</p>

<p>With the amount of &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; I generate online, someone should be able to nail me with ads I can&rsquo;t resist. Yet here we are in 2012 and I still find out about most of the products I buy from people I follow on Twitter/Facebook/Google+, Blogs and Friends. Personal recommendations plus a selection of online reviews seals the deal. There must be a way of packaging that up algorithmic-ally without turning everyone into shills.</p>

<p>Whilst I&rsquo;m on the subject, can all the re-marketing systems please add a button to their Ads called &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already bloody bought it, stop hounding me.&rdquo;? Also another one for all the deals Ads which says &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a man, I don&rsquo;t need an upper lip electrolysis deal of the day&rdquo;</p>

<p>In fact, if an Ad system was announced which said &ldquo;Give us access to your Twitter/Facebook/Google+/Reader/Amazon/4SQ/Yelp accounts and we promise to only show you Ads/Deals for stuff you and your friends talk about positively&rdquo;, I&rsquo;d opt-in tomorrow.</p>

<p>Meanwhile here&rsquo;s a sponsored Tweet from Coke.</p>

<p>I saw this in the control panel for one of my Google Apps for Your Domain accounts today.</p>

<p><a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/googleapps1.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-844" title="googleapps" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/googleapps1.png" alt="" width="783" height="344" /></a></p>

<p>The value-add for paid accounts on Google Apps has always been very poor. $50 per user for a few tweaks most people don&rsquo;t need. This could change things, particularly for those who want to use Google+ as a replacement for Yammer.</p>

<p>Brendan Cunningham has just left <a href="http://conoroneill.net/bandon-flood-data-fews-now-available-on-cosmpachube/#comment-2311">the most exciting comment</a> this blog has ever received. He has thrown some serious smarts at the <a href="http://www.met.ie/weathermaps/Web_radar.gif">Met Eireann radar image</a> of rain and converted in to actual numbers you can use!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.met.ie/weathermaps/Web_radar.gif"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.met.ie/weathermaps/Web_radar.gif" alt="" width="360" height="347" /></a></p>

<p>That vector data with rainfall values is now up on <a href="https://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?docid=1E0Z4OTUfKXHzaLzFQT3aLlzJ-9LeWwcoCFyHsXk">Google Fusion Tables</a>and is updated every 15 minutes so now it can be integrated with GIS and other location based services.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?docid=1E0Z4OTUfKXHzaLzFQT3aLlzJ-9LeWwcoCFyHsXk"><img class="size-full wp-image-835 aligncenter" title="fusion" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/fusion.png" alt="" width="375" height="442" /></a></p>

<p>As he points out, with national coverage like this, you can watch for rainfall trends. Heck, you could even do predictions. He mentions that previous flood data may be available from the OPW and a Benefitting Lands layer from the OSi.</p>

<p>I pointed out to Brendan that this data may be perfect for <a href="http://openweathermap.org/">Open Weather Map</a> which has a radar layer for the US and Canada already. Hopefully there are no rights issues with the data (which I assume the Irish taxpayer has paid for). His follow-up comment seems to indicate that all is ok as long as it&rsquo;s not for profit.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s projects like this that give me hope for Ireland. Where the State is unwilling, unable or simply lacking in knowledge to release #OpenData, we can step in. Motivated, knowledgeable people with a community spirit can make the data we have already paid for, do more for the country.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m working on a small project in this area at the moment and have just received all of the hardware. Once it&rsquo;s ready, I&rsquo;ll publish the PoC here. I hope it will be of benefit to a lot of people.</p>
