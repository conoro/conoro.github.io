                        <p>Google has announced <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/06/update-on-google-health-and-google.html">they are winding down Google Health</a>. I&#39;m terribly disappointed by this as I really thought they had something visionary there. <p /><div>I wrote this piece last year:<a href="http://conoroneill.com/2010/09/05/google-health-android-cardiotrainer-has-me-excited/">Google Health + Android + CardioTrainer has me excited</a></div><p /> <div>Coincidentally, Erick Schonfeldover on TechCrunch,<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/03/keas-bosworth-game-healthy/">interviewedthe creator of Google Health</a>, Adam Bosworth, a few weeks back. He said that the reason it never took off was that</div> <p /><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0.8ex; border-left-width: 1px; border-left-color: rgb(204, 204, 204); border-left-style: solid; padding-left: 1ex;"> Google Health never asked, What could they do that people would want? Instead. they basically offerd a place to store data. People dont want to store data, they want to have fun.</blockquote><p /><div>Hmm, I agree that the lack of any &quot;doing&quot; on the data was an issue but I&#39;m not convinced Social and Fun have any place in my core medical data. I wanted doctors, hospitals, pharmacies etc all filling the data there for me so there was one place for everything. <i>Then</i>, do something with the data. I never want to &quot;check-in&quot; to my pharmacy or become mayor of my liver.</div> <p /><div>I see a bigger fundamental problem here: Google didn&#39;t get buy-in from the data providers. They failed to build the relationships. If you look at Google TV, you see a very similar problem. And if you look at the new Google Music service, the same. Until Google addresses this problem, which is oddly similar to their Social problem, many of these initiatives are going to fail. I&#39;d be interested to see, for example, how many audio device manufacturers they have reached out to since they announced <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/usb/adk.html">Open Accessory</a>. But then Android is the shining example of how Google can knock it out of the park when working within anexistingecosystem.</div></p>

<p><p>With that one line by Alan Sugar on last night&rsquo;s UK Apprentice, I finally realised why Amstrad was never able to grow beyond the odd burst of short term opportunism into a global company. I&rsquo;d like to run a few numbers past Lord Sugar:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Number of Amstrad Music Devices sold last year: 0</li>
<li>Number of Apple Music Devices sold last year: 84m&nbsp;</li>
<li>Market share of phones with e-m@ailer technology: 0%</li>
<li>Market share of phones with ARM technology: 98% globally</li>
<li>Dell market cap: $30.18B</li>
<li> Viglen valuation: &pound;9.99?</li>
<li>Amstrad sale price: &pound;127m</li>
<li>Scientific Atlanta Sale Price: $6.9B</li>
</ul>
<div>The one difference between those companies and Amstrad? Great business people with a global vision working with great engineers with business sense.</div>
<p />
<div>So Lord Sugar, the next time an engineer runs a business or product idea past you, maybe stop thinking about how you can bundle a tape-recorder with it, and listen to her.</div>
</div>
<p />
<div>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be great if the BBC dropped property developer Alan from the Apprentice and replaced him with&nbsp;Herman Hauser&nbsp;who, with the creation of the BBC Micro, is ultimately responsible for what became ARM, a technology that is in nearly every mobile phone on the planet? That&rsquo;s someone I would like my kids to aspire to emulating.</div>
<p />
<div>Herman, by the way, is a Fellow of The Royal Academy of Engineering.</div></p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;My Next Radio ain&rsquo;t a Radio&rdquo;</p>

<p>I did a bit of messing this week on <a href="http://Turntable.fm">Turntable.fm</a> followed by <a href="http://music.google.com">Google Music</a> on my phone and I&#39;ve been doing some mulling.<p /><div>Google Music has been uploading my music collection to the cloud for a week. Probably another week to go. The genius bit is that the new music player on Android then shows all of your music. If a song is not on your phone and you try to play it, it&#39;ll start streaming it. You choose if you only want to do that on Wifi or 3G too.<p /><div>So this morning I drove up to collect Oisn from soccer and, as usual, had my HTC Desire paired by Bluetooth to my Lidl car stereo. Then I picked a Lou Reed song that wasn&#39;t on the phone and Google Music streamed it perfectly over 3G. Very impressed. Obviously will be rubbish in rural West Cork with the poor mobile coverage and I need to watch my data usage. But as a concept I love it.</div> <p /><div>Then you have Turntable.fm. A series of &quot;rooms&quot; dedicated to different types of music with a bunch of DJ slots available in each one. You can grab a slot and upload your music into your queue. The system then round-robin plays each DJs songs and those listening in the room can vote it up or down. Enough &quot;Lames&quot; and your song gets skipped. <a href="http://twitter.com/walter">@walter</a> described it as crack and he is 100% right. It is as close to a perfect game-play driven web-app as you can get. I&#39;ve been in and out to the 80s rooms non-stop for days.I think my DJ name will be Transit van Driver.</div> <p /><div>I&#39;ve never been much of a radio person. I&#39;ll take wall-to-wall music any day over some fools prattling-on or god-awful phone-ins. The only talk radio I ever liked was Howard Stern in SV in 1996. And that was just for laughs. But of course the problem with music radio is the lowest common denominator playlists. So I guess most of us end up listening to our own music on our own phones/ipods. But then that leads to stagnation of tastes as you are not exposed to new stuff.</div> <p /><div>Google thinks (as always) the answer is an algorithm. They have Instant Mix in Google Music. &quot;Here are more songs like the one you arelisteningto&quot;. Yawn, <a href="http://last.fm">last.fm</a> sorted that out years ago.<br /> <p /><div>Then Gordon Murray (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/murrion">@murrion</a>) nailed it &quot;<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/murrion/status/79517724014944257">Wonder if turntable.fm could stream to it</a>&quot;.</div> <p /><div>Imagine the music you listen to in your car is what a bunch of different people in specific rooms on <a href="http://turntable.fm">turntable.fm</a> are playing, streamed to your phone over 3G and then to your dumb head-unit? Bluetooth based thumbs-up/thumbs-down and Room-Switcher for changing songs.</div> <p /><div>Jam in some ads or a subscription service and I&#39;ve got My Next Radio.</div></div></div></p>
