                        <p>#&ldquo;Developers Developers Developers &mdash;&gt; Nokia + Windows Phone 7&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;ll leave all the industry analysis to the experts and insta-experts on Twitter. I&rsquo;m just looking at the Nokia and Microsoft deal from the perspective of a punter and someone who might consider getting apps built for Nokia+WP7.</p>
<p>So as a punter I liked the look of Windows Phone 7 and I love the industrial design of the Nokia N8. I&rsquo;m also sick to death of the shitty cameras that HTC, Samsung et all are putting in their Android phones. My 3 year old N95-8GB takes infinitely better picture and videos than my HTC Desire. A Nokia phone with a good OS and decent Apps is still something I would happily buy. Thinking about average punters, a familiar brand like Nokia running an OS made by someone they&rsquo;ve heard of seems reasonable.</p>
<p>But as we all know, it boils down to apps. Even my technophobe Dad is become App-centric and spends tons of time in GMail, the browser or the RTE News App on his Android phone. I don&rsquo;t think he could ever go back to Symbian now.</p>
<p>I looked at App building on Symbian before and it was a nightmare. Nokia even made something as simple as signing Apps difficult and effectively killed the hobbyist developer market. I thought they were on to something with both Python Apps and WRT as a way of simplifying development and hiding Symbian but as with everything Nokia has done in software in the past few years, they were half-assed, unsupported and then left to die.</p>
<p>This morning I stuck &ldquo;Windows Phone 7 SDK&rdquo; into Google to see where it took me. <a href="http://create.msdn.com/en-US/">App Hub</a> is not the worst site in the world but is missing instant gratification. A video front and center showing how easy app dev is on the platform would be a big help. More importantly, it&rsquo;s not even clear how/what you do development in. I had to Google off-site to find out that when they say Silverlight and .NET framework they mean C#. Maybe every developer on the planet knows that but I didn&rsquo;t. The big plus is that the entire SDK is free and includes an emulator. So pretty much equivalent to the Android setup.</p>
<p>Even better, you can program in Visual Basic. I know I know but I built some really neat quick n dirty but useful apps in the 90s with VB. If you can get Apps out the door quickly with VB then that&rsquo;s a big win. I was desperately disappointed with the Android AppInventor capabilities. Most Apps I thought of started as an RSS consumption widget and it cannot do RSS without running an App on Google AppEngine!</p>
<p>The only obvious downside is the mean-minded $99 to register to publish Apps. Get a grip MSFT, you can afford to drop that and it will encourage kids in bedrooms to get started. All that moaning about crappy Apps in the Android Store is just that, moaning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</p>
<p>The other thing that jumped out at me is that they co-host Windows Phone 7 and XBOX 360 development on the App Hub site. If the same toolset can be used to build apps that connect WP7 to XBOX Games, there is a myriad of possibilities there.</p>
<p>I remember talking to someone in Palm before the Pre was released. It sounded like they would &ldquo;support&rdquo; the porting of iPhone and Android Apps to WebOS. Turns out they meant they would give you early access to the SDK! Unsurprisingly, WebOS flopped completely. If Palm had taken a few million of their marketing budget and handed it out to developers, I think the result could have been different.</p>
<p>Is that something that Nokia and Microsoft has to do to seed development more? I know Microsoft are good at working with schools and colleges to get their tools and apps into kids&rsquo; hands. They also provide lots of support to startups. Do they need to go one step further with WP7 and start handing over devices and even &ldquo;grants&rdquo; to developers to get them porting and creating Apps? I&rsquo;d be very tempted if they did.</p>
<p>Hopefully Nokia can get the first phone out before the summer. Even if they just ported WP7 to the N8 and put in a meatier CPU, I think they&rsquo;d have something great on their hands. I still have a lot of affection for Nokia, as do many people, but time is running out. Fingers crossed.</p></p>

<p><p>I normally wouldn&rsquo;t call a result a few days after a new release but bloody hell, Facebook Places has gone mental in Ireland in less than a week. And I&rsquo;m not talking about geeks. Most of the people I am friends with on Facebook have never heard of Foursquare or Gowalla and yet they are checking in all over the place on FB. It&rsquo;s amazing to watch.</p>
<p>How many years have we banged on about Location Based Services to no avail outside of the early adopter brigade?</p>
<p>All Facebook has to do now to keep the momentum going is to get deals/discounts in place everywhere.</p>
<p>I have been a dedicated 4SQ user since it launched here and an intermittent Gowalla user but I honestly think I&rsquo;ll be giving up on both over the next few weeks.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll finally get my thoughts down here in the next few days about why Facebook Places will slaughter Google Places too.</p></p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;My 368 Days of Posterous - The Stats&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Hard to believe it&rsquo;s been a full year since I started on Posterous. The idea behind it was simple - I was scatter-gunning techie posts across several blogs and they just didn&rsquo;t belong there mixed in with foodie stuff and business. I wanted somewhere I could completely geek-out but with zero effort. Over the year I think most posts have taken 5 minutes to write and the bulk of them were sent by email when I was killing some time or on a lazy Saturday.</p>
<p>So the headline stats since Feb 3rd 2010 according to Posterous:</p>
<ul>
<li>285 Posts</li>
<li>25 Posterous Subscribers</li>
<li>143,147 views</li>
</ul>
<p>As we know, Posterous just randomly invents view numbers so take that last one with a big pinch of salt.</p>
<p>But if the Posterous numbers were right then my initial posts have had 200-300 views over the year and my more recent ones had 3000-4000.</p>
<p>I have to say I&rsquo;m not tempted to move from Posterous despite the lock-in. The auto-tweet and auto-Facebook are the only ways I &ldquo;distribute&rdquo; the posts and that gives me enough feedback to keep me happy.&nbsp;Oh and in case you were wondering, yes, blog comments are dead, I get far more replies to each post as Tweets or Facebook replies. Pity Posterous can&rsquo;t track those and show them in addition to retweet counts.</p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;Sugru Shoes&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>My mum bought some very funny flamenco dresses for my two girls recently in Spain. Total spotty horrors but the girls loved them. She just topped that by getting them spotty flamenco shoes with big stomping wedge heels on them.</p>
<p><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/y_FbbhidxBm_kw0jhyO6UX7Xwtr8dIttXfoQ4cGrw38?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_pMHVPNhiR90/TU6Q1Ez27RI/AAAAAAAAAp8/zKmGfCDFDb0/s288/IMG_20110205_150744.jpg" height="217" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="288" /></a></p>
<p>As they were bought in a local mini-mart in Torremolinos, the quality ain&rsquo;t great, to put it mildly. S&iacute;ofra popped the clasp rivet on hers within a couple of hours and left too big a hole to just pop it back in. I tried a few approaches but nothing worked so I gave Sugru a try. I knew it wouldn&rsquo;t be great as I only had blue sugru but I went ahead anyway.</p>
<p>Another result for the Kilkenny inventor, her Sugru worked perfectly!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I even went a step further and nicked some Airfix paint from her big sister&rsquo;s kit (blogpost on that soon) and painted it red. Not ideal but the 4 y/o is thrilled her shoes are back in action.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;A new lease of life for the Nokia N95-8GB&rdquo;</p>

<p>The only use my old and much loved N95-8GB has had in the past year has been as the backup phone for my Voda SIM when I go to the UK. But I hate seeing still-good tech lay unused.<p /><div>My 11 y/o son is massively into magic at the moment and is damned impressive at doing sleight of hand card tricks. Himself and his best friend have started making videos and posting them on YouTube (hands only!).</div> <p /><div>But the tech they have been using has proven just too damned difficult. It was:</div><div><ul><li>Old Canon DV-CAM with tape removed</li><li>Firewire cable from that to ancient Acer Laptop</li><li>Laptop running Ubuntu Maverick</li> <li>Editing attempted on both Kino and Kdenlive</li></ul><div>Both Kino and Kdenlive are wrecking their heads. It&#39;s not just the horrific UIs, it&#39;s the relentless crashing when they try to do anything. Their needs are pretty simple:</div> <div><ul><li>Record video live</li><li>Maybe over-dub verbal mistakes</li><li>Trim here and there</li><li>Add a title</li></ul><div>Coincidentally, my old HTC G1 phone has become totally unreliable and the youngfella was bitching that he couldn&#39;t even hear people on it so I gave him the N95-8GB and he was happy. Then he discovered that it could record pretty decent video. Then he discovered it can edit video, on the handset!</div> </div><p /><div>So he is thrilled. All their recent videos have used the N95-8GB instead. I think the only thing he can&#39;t do is text overlays. So I have to try and figure that out for him using something else.</div> <p /><div>If Nokia could push the whole &quot;stop being a dumb consumer of content, generate content instead&quot; angle of N8 over other smartphones, they might sell a few more?</div><p /> <p /></div></p>

<p>Over the past few months, I&#39;ve watched Facebook Places functionality get closer and closer to properly live for those of us in Ireland.<p /><div>We geeks initially used VPNs on our phones to spoof that we were in the US so we could check-in in Ireland. Then I spotted the FB Ireland people checking in here.</div> <p /><div>More recently the Android App stopped giving an error and showed check-ins here.</div><p /><div>Now today it&#39;s like everyone found it at the same time! My Facebook feed has tons of Irish check-ins.</div> <p /><div>So how quickly before everyone starts bitching about it like they did with FarmVille updates?</div><p /><div>Of course I won&#39;t be happy until they turn on Facebook Deals in Starbucks at Cork Airport.</div> <p /><div><div>The question is now whether I&#39;ll bother my arse doing my usual 4SQ+Gowalla check-ins? Without special offers local to me, they just can&#39;t compete with FB.</div></div></p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;Introducing \&ldquo;Curation by Me\&rdquo; - A simple tool to filter Twitter Lists&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Sometimes you have to stop blogging and you have to start coding to scratch a persistent intellectual itch. Last week I said&nbsp;<a href="http://conoroneill.net/i-need-self-curated-news-for-the-irish-genera">I needed self-curated news</a> for the Irish General Election. This week I have it.</p>
<p><a href="http://curationby.me">Curation by Me</a> is an incredibly simple tool I lashed together (using the Programming by Google Search method) over the past two nights. It takes the URL of a Twitter list and a hashtag/keyword to provide you with a filtered list of tweets.</p>
<p>By default it shows <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/conoro/general-election-2011">a simple list I made</a> of Irish politics related tweets and shows those tagged with the #ge11 hashtag (used to identify Irish Election tweets):</p>

</div>
</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example using <a href="http://www.mamanpoulet.com/">Suzy Byrne&rsquo;s</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/suzybie/candidates-ge11-3">list of Irish Election Candidates</a> filtered by the word &ldquo;Martin&rdquo; to show those tweets mentioning the name of the new leader of Fianna F&aacute;il:</p>

</div>
</p>
<p>But of course it&rsquo;s not just for politics; any list or filter can be used. The only proviso is that you have to login with your Twitter account to use it, due to Twitter rate limiting.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m the only person on the planet who needs <a href="http://curationby.me">Curation by Me</a>. Even if I am, the itch has been scratched. Would love your feedback, problem reports, thoughts and suggestions.</p>

<p><p>Looking at your stats in Posterous could lead one to be very cocky indeed. Unfortunately they are complete cobblers. That curation one I posted 20 minutes ago supposedly has 226 views already. Here is what Posterous says about one of my recent posts and then what Google Analytics says.</p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;I need self-curated news for the Irish General Election #ge11&rdquo;</p>

<p>So I&#39;m lashing together a quick <a href="http://twitter.com/conoro/general-election-2011-10">General Election list</a> on Twitter for my Dad to follow. He&#39;s not on Twitter but he loves politics and I think he&#39;d get a kick out of it. I started with some of the obvious MSM accounts and then some people<i></i>I know who are interested in politics. Then I looked at some of their lists. I&#39;ve put a simple one together that I think he&#39;ll like. It&#39;s nowhere near finished yet but it&#39;s a start. <p /><div>Except of course it has a huge problem. It shows everything those people are tweeting. Every inanity, every irrelevant detail. What I need is the intersection of that list and the <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23ge11">#ge11 hashtag</a>. There is no way I wouldrecommendhe follows the hashtag if he wants to keep his sanity. 50,000 people all bitching about the same thing at the same time is not interesting to anyone.</div> <p /><div>So does such a webapp or desktop app exist? If not, why not? It&#39;s another Twitter app I would pay for.</div><p /><div>And if it could pull in Wall updates from Facebook Pages of politicians etc, that would be worth even more!</div> <p /><div>Am I the only one on Twitter who needs these kind of tools (like all my Filter requests) or is the perception that the money lies elsewhere?</div></p>
