</p><p>One benefit of the recession is the number of sites being created around special offers. We already work with <a href="http://luckebox.com">Luckebox</a> in this area in <a href="http://www.loudervoice.com">LouderVoice</a> and I know of several others in the planning and Alpha stages.

<p><p>I&rsquo;ll be honest, I see the word &ldquo;innovation&rdquo; and I instantly picture Dilbert&rsquo;s PHB telling them to leverage synergy. It is a word that has effectively become meaningless. But when it is allied to action, then I&rsquo;ll take another look.</p>
<p>I was contacted a while back by the guys in Innovator.ie about an Innovation Workshop but I mis-read the intent and thought it was just for those in the Civil Security Sector. It was only when someone else clarified it for me that I realised what it was all about and it looks very interesting indeed.</p>
<p>This is <a href="http://www.innovator.ie/blog/?p=85">the language that caught my eye</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">
<p>&nbsp;What you and your colleagues will get from this workshop:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">Bring new innovation practices into your business</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">Create sustainable business models for generating new revenue</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">Rapidly amend existing offerings to tap into new markets</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">Take skills learned to easily prototype and create new products and offerings</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.innovator.ie/innovationprogramme.php">The workshops</a> are two days long with a gap between the days as follows:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Newry - March 23rd &amp; March 30th</li>
<li>Dungannon - April 15th&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;April 22nd</li>
<li>Cork - April 20th &amp; April 27th</li>
<li>Galway - May 6th &amp; May 13th</li>
</ul>
<p>They are also not expensive. &euro;250 and 2 staff can attend.</p>

<p><p>In the latest of my tough love posts about Buzz (tagline &ldquo;We&rsquo;re moany bitches cos we care&rdquo;), I take a screencast of what was displayed to me when I checked Buzz this morning:</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/I8d_ObDycAI?wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen frameborder="0" height="417" width="500"></iframe></p>
<p>6 weeks later and they still think this is acceptable.</p>
<p>TURN OFF THE GODDAMMED EXTERNAL FEEDS IN BUZZ NOW.</p>
<p>Thanks sweeties.</p>
<p>In other Buzz news, I discovered last night that someone with a clue in Google turned on the ability for those with non-2.x versions of Android to access it. It remains the best way to use Buzz by far. The reality is Buzz should have been launched as a mobile-only product. If all the focus had gone there, Foursquare and Gowalla would be crapping themselves instead of laughing themselves to sleep every night.</p>
<p>Or if they&rsquo;d had some joined-up thinking, it would have been the address book in Android from day 1. Ye know, what we all thought they bought Jaiku for.</p>
<p>Apologies to @interactivemark for using his Friendfeed stream import in Buzz to highlight the problem.</p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;Save a packet on O2 Mobile broadband. Cancel and re-subscribe&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had O2 mobile broadband for something like 2 years. I haven&#39;t used it much at all in the past few months and cancelled it a few weeks back. It was costing 30 p.m. for 10GB. <p /><div>However the ongoing problems with Eircom DSL <em>every</em> <em>single</em> <em>night</em> from 7pm to midnight has been driving me insane. Throughput drops to almost 0bps. The feedback I see on Twitter is that I&#39;m not the only one and Cork seems to be particularly bad.</div> <p /><div>So I finally setup the big assed external antenna connected to a Huawei E176 dongle and all seemed ok on that front as a backup. But Vodafone mobile broadband in Bandon is brutal due to really minuscule backhaul.</div> <p /><div>Yesterday I trotted off down to the O2 Shop in Bandon to sign up again. Now I&#39;m getiing 15GB a month for 16.99 (normally 19.90). So my top Monday money saving tip - check your O2 bill. if you are giving them 30 a month for your dongle, cancel it.</div> <p /><div>Quick update on the external antenna. Yes it works in the attic, yes I get HSDPA but the throughput is very poor. So I&#39;m going to have to bite the bullet and mount it outside somewhere where previous tests showed good throughput.</div> <p /><div>Second quick update - the E176 works perfectly plugged into my Billion Router.</div></p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;ve been blogging since 2001 and have long since lost any interest in stats on my blog posts. I never check non-biz related stats. But for interest&rsquo;s sake I&rsquo;ve been monitoring conoroneill.net since it is a brand-new blog.</p>
<p>I dunno if these stats are good, bad or indifferent for a new blog that is 99% promoted via Twitter and Facebook links. The one that jumps out at me is that whilst Twitter generates 18% of the visits, Facebook only generates 4%. That&rsquo;s a reflection of the much smaller number of people I&rsquo;m connected to on FB and their mainly non-tech demographic.</p>
<p>So according to Posterous since Feb 3rd 2010:</p>
<ul>
<li>102 Posts</li>
<li>2,220 site views</li>
<li>Most viewed post had 690 views (mainly cos <a href="http://mulley.net/">Damien</a> Fluffed it): <a href="http://conoroneill.net/how-do-you-get-your-irish-web-business-news">How do you get your Irish Web Business News</a></li>
<li>Second most viewed post had 656 views (ditto re the fluffing): <a href="http://conoroneill.net/huge-mistake-by-google-with-earth-on-android">Huge Mistake by Google with Earth on Android</a></li>
<li>Third most viewed post had 579 views (un-Fluffed): &nbsp;<a href="http://conoroneill.net/jolicloud-not-what-i-expected">JoliCloud not what I expected</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And according to Google Analytics from Feb 16th to Mar 18th:</p>
<ul>
<li>1,313 visits</li>
<li>1,608 PVs</li>
<li>Direct = 51%, Twitter = 18%, Google = 9%, Posterous = 4% and Facebook = 4%</li>
</ul>
