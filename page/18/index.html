<p>Why? Because we can.</p>

<p>Compiling took a few stabs but not particularly hard. Runs perfectly. Not much else to say.</p>

<p>You can <a href="http://bandonmines.dyndns.org/">try it here</a>. No guarantees I&rsquo;ll leave it running as it&rsquo;s sitting on the world&rsquo;s crappiest DSL line.</p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;Motorola S10-HD are brilliant Bluetooth running headphones&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lovely people in Mobile Fun in the UK, home of a bajillion mobile and iPad accessories,contacted me recently. I&rsquo;m a long-time customer of theirs and I&rsquo;m a huge fan. Their Dash Genie in-car phone holder is a wonderful thing that just works.</p>

<p>They asked if I wanted to review anything on their site and I cheekily requested a pair of Motorola S10-HD headphones. They shot a pair over to me for free immediately.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had them for a few weeks and they are just superb. Like a fool, I bought a pair of S9&rsquo;s on eBay a few years ago. I didn&rsquo;t suss that the only way they could be so cheap was if they were knock-offs. They fell apart in no time. These <em>real</em> S10-HD&rsquo;s are in a different league altogether.</p>

<p><a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/B2C-cnp2184-1-new-lg-US-EN.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-724 aligncenter" title="B2C-cnp2184-1-new-lg-US-EN" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/B2C-cnp2184-1-new-lg-US-EN.png" alt="" width="316" height="295" /></a></p>

<p>The design is unusual in that they basically clamp on to your head. Some people with particularly big noggins report that they are uncomfortable but I found after two uses that they fit perfectly.</p>

<p><a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/B2C-S10-3-new-US-EN.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-725 aligncenter" title="B2C-S10-3-new-US-EN" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/B2C-S10-3-new-US-EN.png" alt="" width="328" height="200" /></a></p>

<p>The reason I wanted them was for running. I hate the normal in-ear wired headphones that fall out constantly and tie you in knots with the wires as you run. With these, I pair via Bluetooth A2DP to my HTC Sensation strapped to my arm and I listen to all my podcasts and music. It has volume and track selection buttons on one side.</p>

<p>However it also works as a handsfree for the phone. If you are listening to music when an incoming call arrives, it mutes it and you can press a button to accept the call. I tested this paired to my laptop and made a few perfect quality Skype calls with it.</p>

<p><a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/B2C-S10HD-Global-packaging-life-US-EN.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-726 aligncenter" title="B2C-S10HD-Global-packaging-life-US-EN" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/B2C-S10HD-Global-packaging-life-US-EN.png" alt="" width="376" height="369" /></a></p>

<p>The big test was this morning where I ran a sweaty Bandon 10km and listened to Kermode and Mayo&rsquo;s movie reviews for an hour. I was chuffed that they worked perfectly, never slipped and did not hurt after an hour. I assume the same will be true when I do the Cork Half Marathon in June. Run Keeper is also able to temporarily mute the podcast and tell me my pace every 1km. Nice.</p>

<p>Not much more to say. They work perfectly. They come with a variety of ear-plug sizes and they are great value. I&rsquo;ll be using nothing else from now on when running.</p>

<p>Thanks again to the Mobile Fun crew. Still the first site I go to when I want to get something for my phone.</p>

<p>UPDATE June 5th 2012: I ran the Cork Half Marathon yesterday with the S10-HD connected to my HTC Sensation. They worked beautifully. No battery issues, no drop-outs and my head wasn&rsquo;t sore afterwards. Which is more than can be said about the balls of my feet.</p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;Alleluia - How to specify which Google Account in the URL&rdquo;</p>

<p>I have been driven demented by Google&rsquo;s multi-login feature since it launched. Every damned tool of theirs seems to do it differently. The good ones let you flick seamlessly between accounts (Google+). The awful ones won&rsquo;t let you select an alternative (yes you Picasa Web) and if you logout, you logout of everything. And of course, they always default to the one you don&rsquo;t want (hellooo Google Reader).</p>

<p>I had a brainwave a few minutes ago - what if there was a way of specifying which account you want to use in the URL when accessing a Google application? And it turns out, praise jebus, there is. All you have to do is tack on ?authuser=N to the URL (or &amp;authuser=N if there is already a parameter on the URL) where N=0 for the default account (i.e. the one you logged in with first), N=1 is the next account you logged in with, etc etc.</p>

<p>So now, rather than clicking a general bookmark for Google Reader which always goes to my unused loudervoice.com Reader account and then I have to switch, I can set the bookmark to <a href="http://google.com/reader?authuser=1">http://google.com/reader?authuser=1</a> and go there directly.</p>

<p>Unfortunately it doesn&rsquo;t work for Picasa. Why Google, why?</p>

<p>One less thing to bug the crap out of me each day :-)</p>

<p><pre><code class="language-bash">sudo apt-get install xrdp</code></pre>
Then run Remote Desktop on your Windows 7 PC to view the RPi desktop. Works just as well with VNC.</p>

<p>Simples. And works surprisingly well.</p>

<p>Sorry, very busy, so zero production values in this video. Three snippets jammed together but I go from closed delivery packet to fully booted and operational <a href="http://raspberrypi.org">Raspberry Pi</a> with browser running in a few minutes.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-c07VNczZE">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-c07VNczZE</a></p>

<p>Few immediate thoughts:
<ol>
    <li>Shockingly small. You don&rsquo;t realise just how small until it is in your hand</li>
    <li>It just works</li>
    <li>The CPU is fine but I think the 256MB RAM is going to be a problem fairly quickly. Most modern Linux apps expect more.Building Fuse from source took a bunch of tries as GCC ran out of memory until I found a low-memory setting</li>
    <li>It&rsquo;s slow but acceptably so</li>
    <li>It runs almost cold .Gotta love the ARM architecture.</li>
    <li>They should only highlight one Linux distribution on the site and put everyone&rsquo;s focus on that. Far too early for fragmentation or trying to please everyone.</li>
    <li>Should boot into XWindows by default and then show a &ldquo;Welcome to RPi&rdquo; screen like Linux Mint.</li>
    <li>The efforts on XBMC etc are very exciting</li>
    <li>Wireless keyboard and mouse saves you one USB port</li>
    <li>8GB Class 6 MicroSD in an adapter worked fine as the boot device</li>
    <li>Full-size SD cards for pennies on sites like 7DayShop</li>
    <li>It needs HW-accelerated GUI and decent Java support quickly</li>
    <li>I&rsquo;d love to see someone put together RPi in a case with keyboard and mouse as cheaply as possible. In fact they should make it a competition. I have a $6 keyboard coming from HK at the mo.</li>
</ol>
Lots more stuff I want to try out at the weekend including making a nice case for it. Expect more posts from me in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>A Centipede clone written by me in Z80 Assembler in 1985. Now running on the Fuse ZX Spectrum emulator on the Speccy&rsquo;s spiritual successor, the Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p>This quick n dirty video covers most of it, but in summary:</p>

<p>Pros:
<ol>
    <li>It&rsquo;s 88, in total, including EMS shipping</li>
    <li>Android ICS</li>
    <li>Capacitive Screen</li>
    <li>Full Android Market</li>
    <li>HDMI/USB/SDCard</li>
    <li>1080p video</li>
    <li>Strong GPU for all games</li>
    <li>It&rsquo;s 88, in total, including EMS shipping</li>
    <li>It&rsquo;s 88, in total, including EMS shipping</li>
</ol>
Cons:
<ol>
    <li>Screen is only 800x480</li>
    <li>Touch can be unresponsive at times</li>
    <li>CPU may struggle on heavy-duty games</li>
    <li>Some current strangeness with Android Market means apps incorrectly absent</li>
    <li>Upgrading OS a bit fiddly</li>
    <li>No Bluetooth</li>
</ol>
I got mine on <a href="http://www.pandawill.com/eken-t02-tablet-pc-7-inch-android-40-new-10ghz-cpu-4gb-2160p-hdmi-camera-silver-p59340.html">Pandawill.com</a>. Took approx a week to arrive. Make sure to setup an account first before using PayPal to buy. Ididn&rsquo;tand never got any confirmation email from them that order had even beenreceived.</p>

<p>Did I mention that it&rsquo;s88, in total, including EMS shipping?</p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;First two trivial parts of getting App Inventor working on Raspberry Pi done&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been playing a small bit with the Raspberry Pi VM on VMware to see what&rsquo;s possible and what isn&rsquo;t. One thing I am eager to try when it arrives on the week of May 14th (YAY!), is to get App Inventor working on it.</p>

<p>There are three basic user parts to App Inventor. The browser-based Designer, the Java-based Blocks Editor and the Phone Emulator (if you don&rsquo;t have a phone).</p>

<p>Yesterday I got the first two bits working with about 2 minutes work. All you need to do is install the OpenJDK. <del>SUN</del>Oracle Java is not available yet.</p>

<p><a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/appinventor_raspberrypi.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-706" title="appinventor_raspberrypi" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/appinventor_raspberrypi-1024x888.png" alt="" width="584" height="506" /></a></p>

<p>The bit that will need more work is the emulator. I think. Ye see, I grabbed the code for the Linux version of the emulator and followed the simple instructions to build it. Then I saw it was building for i386 and of course the RPi is ARM-based. Damn.</p>

<p>A bit of poking around and I realised we were almost in a recursive loop. I was running ARM Linux in qemu i386 emulator on a Virtual Machine and I was trying to run an ARM emulator inside a another qemu i386 emulator inside that. Yes my head exploded too.</p>

<p>But then sense prevailed and I realised that Android is ARM and RPi is ARM, so do we need an emulator at all, or just an Android image compiled for ARM11 inside some sort of wrapper/container?</p>

<p>As an old Embedded guy I should be all over this but I&rsquo;ve forgotten more than I ever learned about cross-compiling and building OS images. Anyone have any ideas on where to start? I popped a question on the relevant App Inventor Google Group too.</p>

<p>Of course all of this may be moot if the 256MB of RAM and 700MHz CPU is not enough to support all of this. But it&rsquo;s worth a try.</p>
