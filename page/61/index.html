 <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><p> Today, Nokia has responded making Ovi Maps 3 <a href="http://www.nokia.com/maps">available for the E71 and E66 too</a>.<br /> <span></span></p><blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote"><p>People will be able to use Ovi Suite to side load the latest country maps onto their devices so they can enjoy offline map browsing alongside free navigation. The process of making the latest version of Ovi Maps available for existing devices is quite involved, but the team managed to include complete navigation functionality. Due to technical constraints in back porting the app to existing devices, unfortunately, it wasnt possible to offer further premium content such as Guide Michelin and Lonely Planet guides. These two devices will also be the last of our S60 3.1 and older devices to sport this version of Ovi Maps. But every upcoming Nokia Smartphone will come with free walk and drive navigation out of the box.</p></blockquote></blockquote></p>

<div class="posterous_quote_citation">via <a href="http://thereallymobileproject.com/2010/04/ovi-maps-3-with-free-navigation-launched-for-nokia-e71-e66/">thereallymobileproject.com</a></div>
 <p>So it appears those millions of N95-* owners can go screw themselves as far as Nokia is concerned. Ovi Maps will continue to ask them for money for voice navigation whilst owners of newer crappier devices like the N97 get it for free.
</p><p>I know Nokia wants us all to upgrade and if they had a phone that was worth upgrading to, we probably would. But 399 for an N900 upgrade on Vodafone IE is a joke. And in any case, you can't get the new Ovi Maps for the N900.
</p><p>Well done Nokia, unless that story is wrong, this confirms my upcoming purchase of a HTC Desire.</p></div>

<p><p>Anyone who knows me is sick of my bitching and moaning about the closed nature of the iPhone. But that closed nature has one huge advantage; a global ecosystem of accessories has built up around it. From cases to speaker docks to headphones, suppliers work with fixed form factors and interfaces.</p> <p>That ecosystem must now be worth hundreds of millions of dollars a year. It strikes me that Android could achieve the same thing but in an open way and with a focus on interfaces rather than form factors.</p> <p>The first and most critical thing needed is an audio interface. This could be a software overlay on USB, it just needs to be defined. Currently Android phones can only connect to docks by 3.5mm jack and with no ability to change tracks etc.</p> <p>Google (and Moto with Droid?) have created phone-specific modules but surely that defeats the point of Android?</p> <p>Whilst A2DP could be the solution, it&#39;s still Bluetooth with all the pairing bullshit that it entails. Maybe NFC could sort that out?</p> <p>I spent the weekend testing an iPod and iPhone dock. We used 2 generations of iPod and 2 generations of iPhone and they &lt;em&gt;just worked&lt;/em&gt;. The poor HTC G1 dangling off the back on an audio cable looked like something from a previous century.</p> <p>So how about it Google? Android should enable business opportunities, not get in their way.<br /> </p></p>

</p><p>Fantastic job by Gordon Murray in putting this together with everyone involved.
</p><p>I also think it's a great opportunity for everyone who has issues with and criticisms of YCYC to express them out in the open and have them addressed clearly by those involved in it.

<p>From recent Tweet by @VodafoneIreland to actual announcement in under two weeks. Nice job VF, for real.</p>
<p>Think of it as a Nexus One with snazzy user interface and optical "trackball".</p>
<p>Or think of it as an iPhone where you are in control, not someone in Cupertino.</p>
<p>All things being equal, this will be my next phone. The only things that might prevent that are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vodafone being stupid and charging a fortune for it on upgrade. *cough* N900 *cough*</li>
<li>Vodafone being stupid and locking it to O2-style iPhone price plans</li>
<li>Google congratulating LouderVoice for launching the first ever Irish Android application and giving me a Nexus One for free</li>
<li>Vodafone congratulating LouderVoice for launching the first ever Irish Android application and giving me a HTC Desire for free</li>
<li>Sony Ericsson magically fixing multi-touch on the X10 and it being available at the same time for the same price with Android 2.1. I really would like an 8MP camera.</li>
<li>Nokia somehow pulling a rabbit out of a hat in the next couple of weeks and announcing a N900++ with 12MP camera and capacitive touch screen, for the same price.</li>
<li>Someone else announces yet another Android phone with just enough knobs on to make me wait even more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Head on over to the Vodafone site to sign-up for notification when the Desire is launched.</p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;Oi Nokia. I&rsquo;m still waiting for my free Ovi Maps&rdquo;</p>

<p><div>Or is it Oy Nokia? Or even Nokia Oy.</div>
<p />
<p>You announced free Turn by Turn Voice Navigation in Ovi Maps on Jan 21st for your newest phones but hilariously not for your &ldquo;flagship&rdquo; device cos it didn&rsquo;t have enough space on C:.&nbsp;</p>
<p />
<div>It&rsquo;s now March 30th and my N95-8GB still asks me for money if I want to use voice navigation.&nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>What&rsquo;s the hold up? If it&rsquo;s technical, all you have to do is make the navigation licence in the current Ovi Maps on N95-8GB cost &euro;0. Job done.<br />
<p />
<div>Get the finger out.</div>

<p><p>I&rsquo;ll be honest, I see the word &ldquo;innovation&rdquo; and I instantly picture Dilbert&rsquo;s PHB telling them to leverage synergy. It is a word that has effectively become meaningless. But when it is allied to action, then I&rsquo;ll take another look.</p>
<p>I was contacted a while back by the guys in Innovator.ie about an Innovation Workshop but I mis-read the intent and thought it was just for those in the Civil Security Sector. It was only when someone else clarified it for me that I realised what it was all about and it looks very interesting indeed.</p>
<p>This is <a href="http://www.innovator.ie/blog/?p=85">the language that caught my eye</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">
<p>&nbsp;What you and your colleagues will get from this workshop:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">Bring new innovation practices into your business</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">Create sustainable business models for generating new revenue</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">Rapidly amend existing offerings to tap into new markets</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">Take skills learned to easily prototype and create new products and offerings</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.innovator.ie/innovationprogramme.php">The workshops</a> are two days long with a gap between the days as follows:</p>
<p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>They are also not expensive. &euro;250 and 2 staff can attend.</p>
