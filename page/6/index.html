                        <p>#&ldquo;How hard can it be to make a simple LED blinking circuit? Conor&rsquo;s stupid questions to self, Episode 5892&rdquo;</p>

<p>Last night after a few glasses of vino, I decided to make a simple blinking LED circuit but I didn&rsquo;t want to involve Arduinos, just discrete components.</p>

<p>Most of that auld internet does them with 555 timers but I don&rsquo;t have any of those so much googling ensued. I finally found one and tried to make it, learning in the process that soldering and Sauvignon Blanc don&rsquo;t mix:</p>

<p><a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/blink1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1276" alt="blink1" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/blink1-1024x968.jpg" width="584" height="552" /></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To be fair, the LED lit, it just wouldn&rsquo;t blinking blink.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve written several times before about how an infamous lecturer in UCD put me off analogue electronics almost for life, so after a bit a clueless fiddling I went to bed.</p>

<p>I tried again this morning and found what appeared to be <a href="https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/17998/ultra-low-power-simple-flashing-circuit">a nicer circuit </a>and I even had the right type of transistor:</p>

<p>A bit of fiddling later:</p>

<p><a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/blink2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1278" alt="blink2" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/blink2-771x1024.jpg" width="584" height="775" /></a></p>

<p>Next year I&rsquo;ll just buy a card in time!</p>

<p><a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/blink3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1279" alt="blink3" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/blink3-1024x904.jpg" width="584" height="515" /></a></p>

<p>I even did a video for the full blinktastic experience:</p>

<p>It was huge in our school. I even had the special plastic medallion/key. For some reason I managed to block out his &lsquo;tache in my memory. Here are two pics from Google Images which match my own experience.</p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;Run the @espruino JS interpreter on Windows&rdquo;</p>

<p>I just got my Kickstarter <a href="http://www.espruino.com/">Espruino</a> yesterday. It&rsquo;s one of those projects that just makes me smile. A tiny board with an ST ARM MCU running a special JavaScript interpreter that can do all the stuff with hardware you would normally associate with C/C++/Assembler/Wiring.</p>

<p><a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/espruino_board.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1261" alt="espruino_board" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/espruino_board.jpg" width="640" height="322" /></a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve only just got started playing with it and I swear it feels like my first days using a ZX Spectrum. The instant feedback of interpreted JS in a console feels exactly like typing BASIC into the Speccy (blog post coming on my Speccy and the Interface1bis soon).</p>

<p>The Espruino Chrome App is pretty basic but I was really excited to see that it has a Scratch-style blocks-editor for generating JS. I love the whole JavaScript/Node-everywhere movement but all those damned brackets/braces are a real hurdle for anyone trying to learn programming.</p>

<p><a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/espruino.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1262" alt="espruino" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/espruino-1024x601.jpg" width="584" height="342" /></a></p>

<p>The Espruino interpreter itself can be compiled for a variety of ST Eval boards, the Raspberry Pi and most boxes that run Linux. I&rsquo;d love to get it running on my DigiX too since its processor specs are almost identical to the Espruino. But it&rsquo;s been over 14 years since I played with BSPs and cross-compilers and I&rsquo;m not sure I have the chops any more.</p>

<p>Gordon, the man responsible for it all, mentioned in the forums that it should compile on Windows using Cygwin. Speaking of 14 years ago, it&rsquo;s about that long since I used Cygwin too. I spent so many hours in the late 90s building XEmacs for Cygwin on my PC.</p>

<p>And whaddya know, it works! It took forever to download all the necessary bits of Cygwin on our crappy DSL but compilation of Espruino took about 30 seconds with no errors. Here&rsquo;s some code in action which grabs the contents of the Espruino web-site home page:</p>

<p><a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/http.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1260" alt="http" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/http.jpg" width="675" height="339" /></a></p>

<p>So if your curiosity is piqued by this very cool project, you can play with the core interpreter on Windows whilst you wait for your board to arrive. I was chuffed to see that the http functionality works fine.</p>

<p>I built it on Windows 7 64-bit so I&rsquo;ve no idea if it runs on 32-bit Windows. You should just need the <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1535134/espruino_cygwin/espruino.exe">EXE here</a> and the <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1535134/espruino_cygwin/cygwin1.dll">Cygwin1.dll here</a>to try it out. Let me know how you get on. I&rsquo;m not 100% sure yet if you need any more of the Cygwin DLLs to access other functionality.</p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;The AND100 Android Box is perfect for Netflix, RTE Player etc&rdquo;</p>

<p>David in <a href="http://www.tvtrade.ie/">TV Trade</a> very kindly gave me an AND100 <a href="http://www.tvtrade.ie/android-box.html">Android Box</a> before Christmas and I&rsquo;m only now finally getting around to reviewing it.</p>

<p><a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Clipboard-1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1256 aligncenter" alt="Clipboard-1" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Clipboard-1.jpg" width="496" height="299" /></a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been keeping an eye on the whole Android TV Stick/Box market for a while. There are so many out there, it is almost impossible to pick one and I haven&rsquo;t been overly impressed with the sticks due to all the compromises involved in getting everything into such a small form factor. Wifi performance in particular seems to be a failing.</p>

<p>This AND100 box is a different kettle of fish. It&rsquo;s a box for a start! It also has wired Ethernet as well as built in Wifi. It comes with a couple of USB ports so you can add a Wireless Keyboard and USB harddisk if you wish. In addition to the usual HDMI, it also has Composite out if you have an older TV.</p>

<p>The only real difference from standard Android 4.x is that they&rsquo;ve added a pretty hokey home page which I could really do without. But so far that&rsquo;s the biggest complaint I can make. It has full Android Play Store and it was a doddle to install Netflix, RTE Player, iPlayer etc.</p>

<p>Android hasn&rsquo;t been optimised for non-touch devices so I was surprised how well the simple IR minimal remote control works. Up/Down/Left/Right play/pause etc is really all you need for most of the Media Apps. Netflix works particularly well compared to the PC version I&rsquo;m used to. The extra wireless keyboard with touchpad deals with those times when you need text input and you find the on-screen keyboard is too much hassle. In an ideal world both remotes would be merged.</p>

<p>All of the media Apps I tried like Netflix worked like a charm which is hardly surprising since it has a dual-core 1.5GHz CPU. The only let-down was XBMC which still doesn&rsquo;t have hardware h264 decoding on most Android devices and struggled to play 720p stuff across the network. But that is more down to XBMC and I hope to see that sorted for most devices in the coming months.</p>

<p>Whilst you can get Roku boxes etc to play Netflix, they are extremely limited and obviously don&rsquo;t run Android. In fact they currently don&rsquo;t even have YouTube. And whilst I love XBMC/RaspBMC on Raspberry Pi, things like YouTube take an eternity to load.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t tried any games on the box so I don&rsquo;t know how the UI would work but there is nothing stopping you from giving it a lash. Whilst I almost never watch RTE, I did try out the RTE Player and it worked perfectly.</p>

<p>Overall, it&rsquo;s a great piece of kit and it should be a trivial exercise to install OpenVPN and connect to your VPN provider so you can access the likes of local BBC or Hulu on it.</p>

<p>The price is actually great compared to many of the Android sticks out there which are far less functional. You also know that if anything goes wrong, you have a local supplier and you won&rsquo;t have to deal with the black hole that is returns to China.</p>

<p>Now if only House of Cards Season 2 would hurry up and get here.</p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;When a 10 year old tiny utility program saves your ass&rdquo;</p>

<p>After many many years on a barely-used 1024-bit GPG/PGP key, I decided to go full-blown 4096-bit recently. More for the principle than anything else, but also to mess around with some secure apps like <a href="http://retroshare.sourceforge.net/">Retroshare</a>, as mentioned by <a href="https://twitter.com/onetruecathal">Cathal Garvey</a>.</p>

<p>Whilst I was as it, I moved to a new much improved longer password and made sure to drill it into my brain over and over.</p>

<p>Yeah, that worked brilliantly&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>

<p>Last night I went to setup Retroshare properly and it rejected the password. 50 attempts later I was no closer to getting in. But I was sure I had the general pattern of the password correct.</p>

<p>Normally you are screwed when this happens, but a bit of googling found program called &ldquo;<a href="http://www.roguedaemon.net/rephrase/README.html">Rephrase</a>&rdquo; which was last updated in 2003. You give it the general patter of your password along with possible character variations and it brute forces all of the possible combinations against GPG. e.g. (T|t)this(I|i)s(M|m)y(P|p)assword. And whaddya know, I was close, I just had a capitalisation wrong! Hurrah.</p>

<p>The idea behind this was to highlight how Lego could do something really powerful for a much wider range of kids than the insanely priced Mindstorms.</p>

<p>I started with this really impressive <a href="http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=8048-1">Lego Technic Dune Buggy</a>that some of my kids assembled ages ago.</p>

<p><a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/8048-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1248" alt="8048-1" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/8048-1.jpg" width="690" height="488" /></a></p>

<p>I then butchered it and added a geared motor, a motor shield, an Arduino Uno, a LiPo battery, an nRF24L01 transceiverand a servo to create FrankenLego:</p>

<p><a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/frankenlego.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1249" alt="frankenlego" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/frankenlego-1024x681.jpg" width="584" height="388" /></a></p>

<p>The basics work ok. Finishing the steering is next along with an improved connection of the wheels to the motor.</p>

<p>All for a fraction of what Mindstorms costs. Yes I know you can get motors for Technic but they are missing a big middle ground here by insisting on sticking with the over-thought over-designed over-priced under-achieving Mindstorms.</p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;DisplayPort to DVI to HDMI to VGA to Monitor - And it works&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yesterday I got caught out in a meeting by having an MBP and a DVI adapter whilst the customer had a VGA projector. Luckily someone else saved the day with a proper Windows laptop with a VGA port :-)</p>

<p>For giggles I just tried daisy-chaining a bunch of adapters I&rsquo;ve collected from various Chinese sources over the last two years. It works. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHVjs4aobqs">Inconceivable</a>! That&rsquo;s $29 fewer dollars in Apple&rsquo;s cofffers.</p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;My Pebble watch just fits, in every way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I have hovered over the Buy button on the <a href="https://getpebble.com/">Pebble site</a> more times than I&rsquo;d like to admit. But I always stopped at the last minute. $150 is a lot of money for a watch when you haven&rsquo;t worn one in years, even if it&rsquo;s a &ldquo;Smart&rdquo; watch. The dreadful reviews of the RunKeeper App didn&rsquo;t help, since that was going to be my main use case.</p>

<p><a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/running_2013.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1240" alt="running_2013" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/running_2013.jpg" width="143" height="191" /></a></p>

<p>Then, just at the beginning of December, I got one as a gift and put it to use the following day with the self-same RunKeeper App in the Clonakilty Half Marathon. That App is indeed close to useless since you cannot start or stop runs with it - the main function most people would be looking for to avoid fiddling with armbands at the start/end of a run.</p>

<p>Disaster then struck as the screen broke and turned into a kaleidoscope of colours and starbursts. I spent much of the run prepping my blogpost on their terrible QA. Despite this I did like seeing/squinting-at my time/pace etc as I trundled slowly around rural West Cork. Somehow, after the race, the display fixed itself. That evening I discovered yet again that I&rsquo;m a moron and found out that the LCD display does that when viewed through polarising lenses, like for example, sunglasses :-)</p>

<p>Similar to most people, I immediately installed some silly watch-faces.</p>

<p><a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/bbc-face.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1237" alt="bbc-face" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/bbc-face.png" width="144" height="168" /></a></p>

<p>I particularly liked the Fair Weather one which uses an App on your phone as an internet proxy. That&rsquo;s a really really smart use of a low-power device. I&rsquo;m expecting to see many more uses of that proxy method over time.</p>

<p><a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/pebble_fairweather.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1238" alt="pebble_fairweather" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/pebble_fairweather.png" width="144" height="168" /></a></p>

<p>In the end I settled on the Glance App which gives me a summary of texts, emails and calls along with the time and overall weather/temperature. I also use Music Boss to control what&rsquo;s playing on the phone.</p>

<p><a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/IMG_20130606_214732-236x300.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1239" alt="IMG_20130606_214732-236x300" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/IMG_20130606_214732-236x300.jpg" width="236" height="300" /></a></p>

<p>The killer feature for me is, surprisingly, the SMS/Phone/IM/etc Alerts. I had thought they were going to be useless since they just replicate what the phone is doing. Except, my phone spends most of its time in my pocket or on my desk, not in my hand. There is something very very cool about getting an alert on my wrist that my phone is ringing or someone is IMing me when my phone is at the far end of the house/office. I still can&rsquo;t figure out how Bluetooth LE is getting such incredible range. Better than our house Wifi! I have the email alerts turned off for the obvious reason. It&rsquo;s also much easier/safer to glance at the alerts whilst driving.</p>

<p>I still find it a bit annoying to have people constantly picking up their phone to check alerts/emails/etc when in conversations. In contrast, a quick glance at the Pebble is far less obnoxious and doesn&rsquo;t interrupt the flow of conversation at all.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m getting 4-5 days on a charge and have already bought a second charging cable. The Pebble has died on me once over Christmas due to forgetting to charge it. Actually, they really need to add a mobile-phone-style charge level on the main screen to avoid this. The other concern I have is the hardness of the front bezel. I already have some marks around the edges after a few weeks. Gorilla Glass for V2.0?</p>

<p>A nice touch is the backlight which only comes on if it detects lots of motion. So a quick flick of the hand shows me the time at night. Almost reminiscent of the original red LED watches :-)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d love to play around with the SDK but haven&rsquo;t had a minute to do so. The fact that they have an RTOS on this baby sends me back to my early career of embedded development. The upcoming App Store should also be a big improvement to the current method of trawling the web for Apps etc.</p>

<p>The main reason I love it is because it just fits. I don&rsquo;t mean physically, I mean into my &ldquo;lifestyle&rdquo;. It has zero learning curve and immediate tangible benefits. You can&rsquo;t ask much more from a piece of technology. Now if only it was half the price!</p>

<p>Take one turkey, an oven with the temperature markings rubbed-off, a food thermometer with a broken probe and you have a recipe for either incineration or salmonella.</p>

<p>Enter an <a href="http://store.arduino.cc/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=11&amp;products_id=195">Arduino Uno</a>, a <a href="https://www.olimex.com/Products/Components/Misc/TC-K-TYPE/">K-Type thermocouple</a>, a sample <a href="http://www.maximintegrated.com/datasheet/index.mvp/id/7273">MAX31855</a> IC, some dodgy soldering from a few weeks ago, an <a href="https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-MAX31855-library">Adafruit library</a> and a <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9393">Sparkfun LCD</a> and you get this:</p>

<p><a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/2013-12-25-12.43.45.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1229" alt="2013-12-25 12.43.45" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/2013-12-25-12.43.45-1024x768.jpg" width="584" height="438" /></a></p>

<p>All rustled up in 15 minutes.</p>

<p>Code and circuit to follow.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t bothered to average out the values so using a bit of human judgement on the instantaneous ones.</p>

<p>UPDATE: So the turkey ended up very dry. I&rsquo;m not sure if the cooking time was excessive or the thermocouple was reading low. I wasn&rsquo;t impressed with its accuracy at room temperature (+/- 2C at least) but I suspect it may have been 10C or more off at 180C. Hmm, just tried it on boiling water and it read 100-104 so perhaps I just cooked the turkey for far too long.</p>

<p>Also, if you want to try this, do yourself a favour and get the <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/products/269">Adafruit MAX31855 breakout board</a>. Soldering to the chip directly was a pain in the ass.</p>
