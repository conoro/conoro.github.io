I just don&#39;t know how they execute that quickly with such a small team and such a gigantic user-base. Seeing Google struggle to keep up is frightening.</span></div> <p />But lets be realistic about theannouncementtoday that many people are saying will be a GMail killer. If Facebook launches an email app that is functionally superior to GMail today, I&#39;ll watch the Late Late Show and a football match this week. Yes, I&#39;m willing to risk my mental health like that for the sake of a bet.<p /> But then, we&#39;d need to see IMAP, Custom Domains, Multiple Accounts, Filters, Sigs, POP3 from 3rd party accounts, Labels, Priority Inbox, Labs, perfect anti-spam etc etc etc.<p /><div><span style="font-family: lucida grande, tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Hotmail killer sure, AOL mail killer absolutely, Yahoo Mail killer maybe.</span><p /><div><span style="font-family: lucida grande, tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: lucida grande, tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">But GMail?

But the current app is terrible.</span><span style="font-family: lucida grande, tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">If they launch an upgraded email app today, then it only needs to be average to grab even more market share from the usual suspects.</span></div> <div><span style="font-family: lucida grande, tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"></span></div></div><div>An interesting aside, my Dad asked me yesterday to finally put a bullet in his <a href="http://eircom.net">eircom.net</a> account and switch everything over to GMail.

</div>
<p>I wrote about theincrediblycheap <a href="http://shop.orange.co.uk/mobile-phones/San-Francisco-from-Orange-in-grey">Orange San Francisco</a> (ZTE Blade) while back. It&#39;s a really good Android phone for 100 PAYG in the UK. I couldn&#39;t resist when I was in London recently and grabbed one in Bayswater. Even the young lad in the shop thought Orange was crazy with the low pricing. </p><p /><div>The phone itself is far far better than you could expect it to be for the price. Good feel, excellent 3.5&quot;capacitivetouch screen, decent 600MHz CPU, 3.2MP camera, GPS, Wifi, 2GB SDCard in the price. Only downsides are slight tackiness/cheapness in the buttons, no ball/optical-joystick and it was riddled with Orange software branding and tools.</div> <p /><div>Luckily theawesomePaul O&#39;Brien from <a href="http://android.modaco.com">Modaco</a> has hacked it and you can root it and de-Orangeify it easily. A couple of quid took care of network unlocking it too.</div> <p /><div>My Dad is not the most technically adept to put it mildly. But he loves email and he&#39;s good with SMS. Whilst he should be relaxing in his retirement at the age of 72, instead he is up to his eyeballs in some high intensity roles. One thing that was driving him mad was that all the young guys he is dealing with have their email on demand, either via Blackberry or iPhone. He has to wait until he gets to his laptop. I tried setting up Nokia&#39;s email client on his e65 but it was a waste of time, he couldn&#39;t make head or tail of it.</div> <p /><div>Earlier in the Summer I walked him through my HTC Desire and he seemed to &quot;get it&quot;. Even if it just did GMail (which he digs) he&#39;d have been hooked. As I mentioned at the time, the iPhone users were bursting blood vessels as they were convinced Android would be far too complicated for him and all he could master would be one button.</div> <p /><div>Cue CJ in Reggie Perrin &quot;I didn&#39;t get where I am today Reggie by using a phone with only one button&quot;.</div><p /><div>However, having said that, I was concerned that a multi-decade Nokia user would have a big problem switching to touch-screen only. It is a big change.</div> <p /><div>So I thought the San Francisco would be a good trial. Instead of him upgrading on Vodafone for some stupid price and then discovering he hates touch screens, why not get the cheap phone, set it up for him, transfer his contacts and let him run with it for a week or two.</div> <p /><div>At Halloween we did exactly that. I walked him through the phone, configured it for his hands-free in the car, showed him how to do GMail, SMS, calling etc and let him at it. He struggled a bit with the on-screen keyboard. The standard Google one is a horror, the one that was default on the phone was awkward but actually the HTC IME isn&#39;t bad so we set that up for him.</div> <p /><div>He had a few simple questions like &quot;how do I forward a text&quot; etc but the only funny one was &quot;how do I call someone that&#39;s not in my address book&quot;. It might sound a silly question but the &quot;phone&quot; bit on Android 2.1 says &quot;dialler&quot;. And he simply didn&#39;t know that that meant &quot;phone keypad&quot;. Some UX work still needed on Android.</div> <p /><div>I&#39;ve checked in with him once a week to make sure [a] he was still happy to be using it and [b] he had no problems. Every response is about how much he loves having email on the go!</div><p /> <div>He says he&#39;ll have some detailed questions for me at Christmas which I&#39;m looking forward to (I bet he wants to install Angry Birds :-D ) but otherwise he is a very happy man indeed.</div><p /><div>The question is whether we bother upgrade him to a better Android phone. We had thought we&#39;d do that when the Desire Z came out with a proper Qwerty keyboard but he hasn&#39;t complained about the lack of keys at all. The other reason for upgrading is that the antenna on the San Francisco is pretty crap. It gets no signal in some parts of their house where the old Nokia would have 2 bars.</div> <p /><div>Of course, my eldest is desperately hoping his Grandad does upgrade so he can move from the G1. The inability to play Angry Birds on that is driving him mad.</div><p /><div>If a phone that good can be made that cheap, Nokia really must be planking themselves. Brand loyalty means nothing if you aren&#39;t delivering for your customers.</div> <p /><div>If you want one of the San Franciscos in Ireland, I believe you can just pop over the border to your nearest Orange shop.</div><p /><div><div>Aside: During this process I discovered that he was on some ancient rip-off Vodafone plan. 500 minutes but ZERO texts included! I have upgraded him to 500 mins + 500 Texts + 1GB Data for a few quid more but his monthly bill will go down as he isn&#39;t paying for SMS any more.</div> </div></p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;Sharing Family Videos using Amazon Cloudfront, CloudBerry, JWPlayer and Wordpress&rdquo;</p>

<p>We have tons of old video going back to 1997 that I have been capturing as MPG files over the past few years with WinTV boxes. They then sat unloved on a harddrive until now. We have recently got family requests for copies of some of the videos and it prompted me to finally do something. I had considered burning DVDs but they are just going to get lost/scratched and I&#39;ve always found generating them to be a complete pain. <p /><div>I switched my thinking to online site which we have used before for very short school-play type snippets. Password protected Vimeo worked fine for that. But I realised it was finally an opportunity to store the videos somewhere safe for the long-term so my focus switched to my old friend Amazon S3. Some fiddling and configuring later and it is working like a charm. So these are the steps:</div> <p /><div><ol><li>Run all the video files through <a href="http://handbrake.fr/">Handbrake</a> to create MP4s at the quality level you want. In our case a lot of the source is Video8 so it starts pretty rough in the first place.</li> <li>Create a bucket on Amazon S3 using the very useful <a href="http://cloudberrylab.com/">CloudBerry S3 Explorer</a></li><li>Note that if you are an S3 noobie, CloudBerry can guide you through the account setup</li><li>Make that bucket a Streaming Distribution. I got this wrong initially and the videos would have to download entirely before playing! See the CloudBerry <a href="http://blog.cloudberrylab.com/2009/12/how-to-configure-cloudfront-streaming.html">instructions here</a>.</li> <li>Use CloudBerry to upload the video to S3. CloudBerry has a throttle so you can keep working away and not saturate your broadband</li><li>Now on your Wordpress blog, you install the <a href="http://www.longtailvideo.com/addons/modules/148/JW-Player-Plugin-for-WordPress?q=">JW Player Plugin</a> and follow the on-screen instructions.</li> <li>Once the video is uploaded you need to get the streaming code for it. CloudBerry can generate the code for you but it is for generic HTML pages, not the WP Plugin. But you use the code CloudBerry gives you as a starting point (see below).</li> <li>Also, all the discussion in the CloudBerryinstructionsabout crossdomain.xml and hosting the JW Player on S3 isirrelevantif you use the plugin and are streaming</li><li>Create a new Wordpress Page or Post. Make it password protected if it is stuff that is not for broadcast to a wider audience</li> <li>Add the following to the page: <span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, Bitstream Charter, Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">[jwplayer config=&quot;ConorVids1&quot; file=&quot;BlahBlah.mp4&quot; streamer=&quot;rtmp://<a href="http://whatever.cloudfront.net/cfx/st/mp4:/">whatever.cloudfront.net/cfx/st/mp4:/</a>&quot; provider=&quot;rtmp&quot;]</span></li> <li><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, Bitstream Charter, Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"></span>You use the info that Cloudberry gave you above to fill out the file and streamer details. The config thing is just a JWPlayer config that you create in the Wordpress settings to suit the height/width of your video.</li> <li>Save</li><li>Done!</li></ol>So far it&#39;s working like a charm. I&#39;ll spend the next few weeks with MP4 conversions and uploads happening in the background until it is all up there, safe and accessible to the family.</div> <div></div></p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;The Importance of Interfaces&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I&#39;ve recently been thinking about how interfaces and standards are so important.</p> <p>One challenge we have as a family with a huge number of kids is playing media when we visit various grandparents or in-laws. During the winter this is even more important. There are only so many DS games, episodes of iCarly or <a href="http://y8.com">y8.com</a> games they will play. The same is true when I&#39;m travelling and I want to chill out with a movie in a hotel and not be gouged.</p> <p>For the past year I&#39;ve tried to do this with a laptop and VGA to Scart adapter. The picture quality is pretty awful but it does work.</p> <p>Something like the new Apple TV initially looked interesting due to its small size. Then I saw the interface specs. No composite out , streaming only, no usb port, no sdcard.</p> <p>So forget that. I then looked at some of the cheap media players on Deal Extreme. They didn&#39;t look too bad but reviews were patchy. Then I heard about the Nationite HDVP-2. <a href="http://mp4nation.net/catalog/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=60&amp;products_id=386">http://mp4nation.net/catalog/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=60&amp;products_id=386</a></p> <p>Wow.</p> <p>1080p playback, composite/yuv/hdmi out, LAN, can take internal HDD, USB port, Sdcard slot, optional WiFi, streams from across network or uses local media, remote control, small size. And the real killer? $79!</p> <p>We&#39;ve used it a bunch of times recently and it just totally rocks.</p> <p>The best example of why a product like this, which only uses industry standard interfaces, is so useful, happened last weekend. </p> <p>My sister wanted to show her daughter&#39;s school play which was on their very cool JVC HDCam. Unfortunately the JVC uses some idiotic proprietary connector for TV-Out and she had forgotten the cable so my usual bag of wires was no use. </p> <p>We were about to shrug and give up when I suddenly thought &quot;wait a sec, what does it use for storage? &quot;. Aha, Sdcard! I popped the card out, stuck it in the side of the HDVP-2 and voila, my niece on the old CRT TV.</p> <p>Whether it&#39;s usb for charging , sdcards, audio jacks, rca jacks, sims, Bluetooth or cigarette lighters, standards and interfaces make your life easier.</p></p>
