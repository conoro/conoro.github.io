                        <p>#&ldquo;This crap is why people infringe copyright&rdquo;</p>

<p>A few weeks back, Leonard Cohen&rsquo;s new album was pre-announced and I went to the &ldquo;<a href="http://www.myplaydirect.com/leonard-cohen/">Leonard Cohen Global Store</a>&rdquo; to buy it. They had a special offer of an extra free track available for download immediatelyif you pre-ordered the MP3s. Which I duly did.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, I couldn&rsquo;t find a link to download the free track anywhere but I wasn&rsquo;t that bothered and waited for the album to be released.</p>

<p>I was very disappointed to realise that the Global Store is just a front for Sony Music. So unlike Louis CK, Lenny is only getting a tiny fraction of the money I paid. Given his hugeglobalfan-base I hope he switches to the direct model for the next album and makes the money he is due.</p>

<p>Finally on Monday the album was released and I was sent a link.</p>

<p>The link let me download the free track. No amount of clicking would show me the album. This was followed by to-and-froing of emails with Sony where they were straight-up about the fact that the store was broken. Eventually I was sent a link to this:</p>

<p><a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/sonymusic.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-549" title="sonymusic" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/sonymusic.png" alt="" width="673" height="532" /></a></p>

<p>Yep, I had to click one song at a time. Also, check out the fantastic layout in Chrome. I was surprised I didn&rsquo;t see a &ldquo;Best viewed in Internet Explorer 5 or Netscape Navigator 2.0&rdquo; in the footer.</p>

<p>So it took a week to download something legally or I could have spent 2 minutes being naughty. Actually the ideal for everyone would be that I pay the money and then I go to adodgysite to get what I need.</p>

<p>Sony, EMI and the other dinosaurs need to spend less money hiring lawyers and more money hiring developers, UX designers and people who understand 21st century business models. Otherwise they will be gone the way of the East India Company in the next 3 years. Tick tock.</p>

<p>I emailed the three TDs in Cork South West (2 FG, 1 Lab) two days ago about #stopSOPAIreland. Noel Harrington&rsquo;s office (FG) replied within a few hours by email in a pretty generic but still positive way.</p>

<p>This morning I got a letter in the post(!) from Jim Daly (FG) with a very detailedresponsegiving the official line as expressed by Sen Sherlock. Kudos to whoever in his office wrote the letter, it had all of the pertinent information. Sidenote: If they replied by email the country would be less broke.</p>

<p>According to the letter (see below), consultations were had with these mythical fifty stakeholders that Sen Sherlock keeps referring to, last June/July.</p>

<p>Is the Minister of State able to identify even one &ldquo;stakeholder&rdquo; who represented the interests of webhosts like Blacknight, web infrastructure providers like Amazon, major Social Media companies like Facebook, Search/Video companies like Google/YouTube, online Gaming companies like PopCap, Enterprise Ireland, the IDA or the average internet user? We have already confirmed that he never talked to the Irish Internet Association.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll still waiting on theMinister&rsquo;sLabour colleague in Cork South West to reply.</p>

<p>UPDATE: Several people on Twitter have pointed out that I&rsquo;m not reading this correctly. There were 50 submissions but we have no idea how many Stakeholders. It could be 2. Much more disturbing is Steve White&rsquo;s comment below. His post highlights that the submissions were not specific to the Statutory Instrument at all.</p>

<p><blockquote>Over the past 12 months, standing desks went from popular life hacks meme to eyeroll-inducing sign of a certain type of tightly-wound techie, similar to emptying your email inbox. Several people have asked me if I&rsquo;m still standing. The answer is yes. Here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve learned from 365 days of being a professional stander.</blockquote>

<p>Good post from Gina. I&rsquo;ve been using the standing desk less and less recently and guess what? My neck, knee and shoulder pain is back.</p>

<p>So that&rsquo;s it. Back to half-day standing from right NOW.</p>

<p><blockquote>How much better would social search be if Google surfaced results from all across the web? The results speak for themselves. We created a tool that uses Googles own relevance measurethe ranking of their organic search resultsto determine what social content should appear in the areas where Google+ results are currently hardcoded.</p>

<p>All of the information in this demo comes from Google itself, and all of the ranking decisions are made by Google&rsquo;s own algorithms. No other services or APIs are accessed.</blockquote>

<p>A funny pointed site by some Facebook, MySpace and Twitter Engineers. Of course, if Facebook and Twitter just let Google index them instead, maybe Goog wouldn&rsquo;t show a preference for its own site&hellip;&hellip;.</p>

<p>I think I&rsquo;ll use the bookmarklet anyway for kicks n giggles.</p>
