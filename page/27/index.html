<p>I helped my Dad setup printing from his iPad to his HP wireless printer over the Christmas. The easiest way is just to email the private address of the printer using the HP ePrint service. But I spotted that they have an iPad App too and I installed it.</p>

<p>Oh dear god. An ususable, counter-intuitive steaming pile of garbage. It doesn&rsquo;t even have a Wizard to help you setup. Just a blank screen and some buttons.</p>

<p>I finally sorted it out after 15 minutes of messing. And then reverted to using the email method.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to congratulate HP on killing the TouchPad. Even they realised that they haven&rsquo;t the first clue how tablets work.</p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;Mini-Review of Google App Inventor Beginner&rsquo;s Guide by Ralph Roberts&rdquo;</p>

<p>The nice people in Packt Publishing sent me a free review copy of<a href="http://www.packtpub.com/google-inventor-for-powerful-android-apps/book">Google App Inventor Beginner&#39;s Guide</a> by Ralph Roberts recently. As someone who adores <a href="http://appinventorbeta.com/">App Inventor</a>, I was thrilled to see the book being published. I&#39;ll do a full review later as I haven&#39;tfinishedit yet but I wanted to get some initial thoughts out there as I think the book is worth buying. <p /><div>There are two big problems with App Inventor at the moment. One isobviouslythe shutdown by Google in three days time, before MIT is ready to take it over. I think this is a bad mistake by Google and means a lot of the goodwill towards the project may be lost. Luckily MIT is releasing early versions of the code so you can setup your own server. This will allow some of us to keep going in the gap period.</div> <p /><div>The second problem is the quality of the initial tutorial material. Whilst the examples are of kid-friendly Apps, the descriptions are far too technical and concise. I&#39;ve had to re-write some of them for a non-technical Primary School audience and even the re-writes have needed simplifying.</div> <p /><div>So a book like this is really badly needed by educators and overall I&#39;d recommend purchasing it if you want to get to grips with App Inventor. I only have two real criticisms. It&#39;s very obvious they have quickly hacked in some mentions of the Google shutdown. A 2nd Edition will probably be required in March/April once the MIT move is complete. But that&#39;s hardly the author&#39;s/publisher&#39;s fault.</div> <p /><div>The second criticism is that I think the first few chapters need a re-do. They flip between extremely simplistic descriptions and details like setting up Linux device drivers. This makes it quite confusing for beginners. They should pick one platform (Windows really) and base everything on that. All the nitty gritty of Linux/Mac etc should move to the Appendices. Also the Emulator and connecting to phones shouldn&#39;t be mentioned until it is time to run the first tutorial App. In fact, rather than going through each feature in each screen one-by-one whether basic or advanced, Chapters <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> should consist of a very basic tutorial from going to the App Inventor site to running on the emulator or phone.</div> <p /><div>Once they get into actual tutorials, the book flows quite well. I&#39;d love to see a stripped down version of it for kids K-12 that could accompany the main book for maybe $2-$3 per child. I know 60 who&#39;d love to have something they could bring home after school!</div></p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;Just had a Horrible Thought. Could I move from Posterous to Google+?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&#39;ve always loved the easiness of Posterous but it still has enormous problems with comments and Social Logins and I&#39;m getting really tired of it. The lack of an official Export feature (yes I know about the API) always worries me too. <p /><div>My default would be to switch to good old self-hosted WordPress plus something like Amplify for sharing interesting pages as posts.</div><p /><div>But I just had the scary thought that Google+ could be &quot;good enough&quot;. The Data Liberation Front means I don&#39;t have to worry about lock-in and the sharing features are pretty darned good. But of course all my old posts wouldremainstuck on Posterous and I can&#39;t have a custom domain.</div> <p /><div>Ah ok, maybe I&#39;ll stick with the WP idea.</div></p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;The Death of Boxee&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Boxee <a href="http://blog.boxee.tv/2011/12/26/boxee-1-5-fall-software-update/">finally told us</a> what we all knew was coming, they are dropping support for PC/Mac/Linux. And with that, we now know they are done. I predict they will either shut up shop before this time next year or be sold for chump change by their VCs. Rumours that they are already hawking themselves around to CE companies sound reasonable.</p>
<p>Boxee got all of its buzz and online promotion from early adopters like me who loved their fork of the XBMC code-base. It worked brilliantly on both Windows and Linux for me. Then the updates stopped as they tried to release the code for the D-Link Boxee Box. This was an unmitigated disaster. The box that was released was, by all accounts, unusable. Even now, I see constant problem reports.</p>
<p>This was followed by the partnership with Iomega who finally managed to stagger out with a box recently, probably 6 months late?</p>
<p>And whilst all of this has been going on, what has happened? The rise of the Second Screen. The sad fact is that I don&rsquo;t need Boxee any more, I just need something (anything) that can play a wide range of media formats. i.e. pretty much any media app or box out there. All of the Social stuff has moved to Tablets and Smartphones. It never really worked on the big screen.</p>
<p>Strangely Boxee admit as much <a href="http://blog.boxee.tv/2011/12/26/boxee-1-5-fall-software-update/">in their blogpost</a>. It reads as a farewell.</p>
<p>As for super-smart connected TVs? Oh please. I spent the 90s working on digital TV software for the likes of Philips and Toshiba. Despite all their attempts to be more, these companies have never succeeded at doing any more than shipping LCD displays. The future belongs to Android and iOS with Social EPGs in our hands controlling everything. And those Apps won&rsquo;t be, can&rsquo;t be, Boxee.</p>
<p>So long Boxee, and thanks for all the fish.</p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;The Technical Magic of Playing a Song in Our Car in 2011&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the olden days (as my kids call the 90s), we turned on the radio in the car and played music or stuck a tape in a tape deck. In recent years we&#39;d plug a phone, iPod or USB stick into a car stereo. Now we are messing with streaming more. It&#39;s still as patchy as hell in Ireland with all the mobile blackspots on our motorways but we had a reasonable amount of success yesterday doing the M8-M7-M3 run.<p /><div>Sidenote: And what a marvellous road that M3 is. Anyone not using it on principle? Nah,didn&#39;tthink so. </div><p /><div>As we lashed along the M3, with each of us calling out songs to play next, I realised we were using a huge amount of technology to get Led Zeppelin, Rock and Roll, playing out through the car speakers. Here&#39;s a diagram of it.</div> <p /><p /><div><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>
<a href="http://getfile8.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/conoroneill/vt1qRQOgBRvDqB1Halo1dCY66H3t1WpDYatbWRnPNKdrnAgCMDCSniAARz5z/StreamingYouTubeinCar_1.png"><img alt="Streamingyoutubeincar_1" height="375" src="http://getfile9.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/conoroneill/rBEdyyRVQd9Pz9Rf1Wina3VdYdzjEvlZMqbx3vxWOGsOzbHvyWrJrTML0983/StreamingYouTubeinCar_1.png.scaled.500.jpg" width="500" /></a>
</div>
<br /></div><p /><div>The two key bits are Bluetooth A2DP to the car stereo and my HTC Sensation acting as a Wifi portable hotspot so the youngfella wouldn&#39;t incur any mobile data charges. Apart from the odd bit of buffering, we reached Cavan with Queens of The Stone Age, No One Knows, at top volume.</div> <p /><div>I think it&#39;s good to stop everyone once in a while and marvel at the magic of all of this. My first job was writing code for a GSM basestation and there were thousands of people involved in just that. Think about every piece of the mediadeliverychain and how many people were involved in creating it. We humans can be pretty awesome sometimes.</div> <p /><div>Oh and this was the top tune in our car, played over and over on the trip. A soundtrack you should definitely buy. A bajillion times better than the dire movie.</div><p /><div><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/s21iRlT-uxA?wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen frameborder="0" height="417" width="500"></iframe> </div><p /><div>Happy Christmas!</div></p>

 <p>Lego went down a terrible bolt-hole with all the boy-movie-centric crap. Good for biz in the short term but leaves behind 50% of the potential target market. 
</p><p>Our 8 y/o daughter loves Lego, but it's the normal building blocks she likes so she can make architectural stuff (like the wonderful Ad above), not all that character-driven single-use rubbish.
</p><p>I'd love to see kits for London Eye, Empire State, Golden Gate, Olympics 2012 etc that would appeal to boys and girls. And, as I said before, a Mindstorms that average families can afford.
</p><p>As for this pastel cutesie nonsense they are trying to do now for girls, we have enough stupid barbies in the house with the 5 y/o daughter's obsession, we don't need any more of that thanks.</p></div>

<p>If you ever did anything on Google<a href="http://www.appinventorbeta.com">App Inventor</a>, you have 9 days to download your code.<p /><div>I had to log in 30 times to download all the projects of the kids in our school (30 teams of 2). Next step is to setup a private instance of App Inventor on App Engine and EC2 in lieu of MIT being ready. </div></p>

 <p>I like the Cloud 9 IDE but it isn't integrated into my workflow. 
</p><p>nide, OTOH, is installed on my servers. On first try, I love it already. Editing code in the browser is so much easier than using console Emacs/VIM or SFTP remotely. It looks like they have tied Git support in too.
</p><p>They need to add some sort of simple access control soon and I'll be a complete convert. 
</p><p>Try it.</p></div>

                        <p>#&ldquo;We Need a Shrine to Tomorrow&rsquo;s World in The Grafton Arcade&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Ask many people of a certain age (around 40) where they first encountered a computer and you will invariably hear &ldquo;Tomorrow&rsquo;s World in the Grafton Arcade&rdquo;. Yet strangely if you google it, most of the <a href="http://conoroneill.com/2007/11/13/more-science-week-stuff/">mentions online</a> are by me <a href="http://conoroneill.com/2005/04/04/the-apprentice-uk/">since 2005</a>.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t overstate how important that shop was for several years in the 1980s. Just like the first McDonald&rsquo;s on Grafton Street was a Mecca for us muckers up for our Christmas shopping in the 80s, so too was Tomorrow&rsquo;s World for anyone who knew what a home computer was.</p>
<p>It was a school trip to Dublin by St Kieran&rsquo;s College Kilkenny in 1982 that led me to where I am today. And that is no exaggeration. BASIC -&gt; Forth -&gt; Z80 Assembler -&gt; Fortran -&gt; C -&gt; C++ -&gt; Python -&gt; JavaScript. 1982 -&gt; 2011.</p>
<p>One of the lads on the trip had been to Tomorrow&rsquo;s World before and brought a bunch of us with him.&nbsp;They had a variety of US machines like the TI-99/4A (the first and last time I touched one) but they also had the ZX81, and it was love at first sight.</p>
<p>I badgered my parents for one in the latter part of 1982 and luckily for me, Sinclair released the ZX Spectrum around that time. My Dad arranged for a co-worker in the UK to grab one from WH Smith and a secret meeting in a hotel in Portlaoise landed the 16K model in my lap.</p>
<p>I have genuinely never looked back. I also still have that Spectrum and it still works.</p>
<p>I googled Tomorrow&rsquo;s World this evening and finally found <a href="http://books.google.ie/books?id=4xhJY6ZtyO4C&amp;pg=PA743&amp;lpg=PA743&amp;dq=tomorrow's+world+grafton+arcade&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JuMaw5zhTo&amp;sig=GMUxYOpig_Aa2sl62tCy7OpgHZI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mJDvTvLPNMOIhQfp7cnOCA&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=tomorrow's%20world%20grafton%20arcade&amp;f=true">some other mentions of it in New Scientist</a>. It was an ad for a HP Scientific Calculator from December 1982. Poor HP, always launching things at exactly the wrong time.</p>
<p>Some screenshots from Google Books of the Ad in question:</p>

<p>But what is the modern Spectrum of the 201x years? It&rsquo;s certainly not the iPad, which is the Nordmende TV to our Spectrums. It is (mainly) a consumption device, just like most consoles. Can I suggest that it is Android phones and <a href="http://appinventoredu.mit.edu/">Google App Inventor</a>. If I&rsquo;d had tools like that back in 1982, I&rsquo;d have been doing a hell of a lot more than drawing circles on the screen in BASIC. The future is mobile and we need all of our kids to be completely adept with everything mobile.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do an updated report on how things are going with App Inventor lessons in my kids&rsquo; school over the Christmas. Suffice to say that it has been very very very slow but we are finally seeing some great results, particularly from kids who have never used a PC or smartphone before. I am optimistic for their futures as creators, not consumers.</p>
<p>But back to Tomorrow&rsquo;s World. I think it&rsquo;s time for a plaque on a wall on Grafton Street like those ones for famous authors: &ldquo;Tomorrow&rsquo;s World 198x-198x. They accidentally kick-started the entire IT industry in Ireland.&rdquo;</p>
