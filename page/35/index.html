                        <p>#&ldquo;Today I \&ldquo;Attic-ed\&rdquo; Some Of My Favourite Old Tech&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I did a big clean out of one of our big cubby holes upstairs that held a lot of my old tech from the past few years. Anything that was already of no practical use had been moved to the attic when we originally moved to Cork back in 2004. This stuff was in the &ldquo;well you never know, I <em>might</em> need it some day&rdquo;. And of course I never did need it. So the next batch headed to their Toy Story 3 fate in the attic.</p>
<p>As I packed them up, I took pics of some the ones that I have strong memories of. Here they are:</p>
<p>Dell Inspiron 3700. Never the best laptop but travelled the world with me in the early 00s. Bulletproof. Still works. I could not find a Dell latop that had the right mix of price and performance recently. They really seem to have lost the plot.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A generic crappy floppy disk drive. I posted this because if you look closely, you&rsquo;ll see I bought it from <a href="http://www.dabs.com">Dabs</a> in 2000. I&rsquo;ve been a customer for over 11 years. I&rsquo;ve given them tons of business and referrals and yet their customer service has been completely AWOL over the missing PSU I ordered two weeks ago. If they don&rsquo;t sort it out asap, I&rsquo;m never buying from them again.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Palm Tungsten T. A truly wonderful PDA. The best industrial design I&rsquo;ve ever seen in such a product. Doing what Apple does with the iPhone, a long long time before them</p>
<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-H-yYE0QonGk/Tg8hqQwcS0I/AAAAAAAAJh4/4H0awDXhvbw/s400/IMG_20110702_144614.jpg" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A WinTV video grabber card. How many of these devices have I bought over the years and I never use them to the degree I plan? Hauppauge also write the worst software I have ever used.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-P9Buq_QKsyw/Tg8iNG8SjFI/AAAAAAAAJh8/aMF2TCvKwtQ/s400/IMG_20110702_144834.jpg" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Memories of unscrewing the phone wall-plate in a ropey pub B&amp;B in Ely Cambridgeshire in 1998 so I could connect my laptop with crocodile clips at some joke of a speed to grab my mail back in Dublin. We were helping to get the first Toshiba-powered OnDigital box launched. I also figured out how to make this card work with Windows 2000 after Psion told me they wouldn&rsquo;t support Win2k. Hence it was the last Psion related product I ever bought.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-qYOuAHMAPOU/Tg8iXMNs5wI/AAAAAAAAJiA/k0T73Nsy62o/s400/IMG_20110702_144917.jpg" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I bought this multimeter around 1984 from Maplin by mail-order so I could build add-on cards for my ZX Spectrum. Still works perfectly. Partially responsible for me doing Electronic Engineering in UCD.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-3D1TsR3jH6g/Tg8inOj5pdI/AAAAAAAAJiI/PMXuA4ZFWlw/s400/IMG_20110702_145014.jpg" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Redhat 8.0 eh? 2003. Cannot remember why I named a machine &ldquo;bejing&rdquo;. My first Linux install was Slackware in 1996 when I was in Sunnyvale. A horror to install and configure.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-zZl06A-Zb08/Tg8iu0KexPI/AAAAAAAAJiM/4kh12n2tXck/s400/IMG_20110702_145036.jpg" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An &ldquo;Enterprise&rdquo; level 10Mbs Wifi router. Interesting design, has a removable PCMCIA card in it. I had big plans to use this for that point-to-point wireless community network that people were trying to kick off in <sup>2002</sup>&frasl;<sub>2003</sub>. Never happened. I think these came out around the time 3Com decided they were getting out of the networking business and going to put all their efforts into an Internet Appliance called Audrey. Ahhh, I miss the insanity of the 1998-2001 tech bubble.</p>

<p>Great wee networking card. Back in the day when laptops didn&rsquo;t have lan ports.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From 1996 to 2006, I bought a lot of gear in the US on my visits. Mainly in Fry&rsquo;s but also Best Buy and CompUSA. So of course I needed a US power strip.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My wonderful Casio FX700G graphing calculator. Bought in a big electronics store on Koenig Strasse in Stuttgart in 1988 when I spent the summer in Esslingen working in an old folks home. This calculator got me through a bunch of exams in UCD. I&rsquo;m still rubbish at stats tho. I tried powering it up with new batteries today but no joy. Gutted.</p>

<p>Fuji Endeavor APS camera. My last non-digital camera. Solid but not spectacular. Think I got it in the States?</p>

<p>Ahh, who doesn&rsquo;t have one of these Nokia data cables?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried many times to switch to this trackball to deal with my RSI. I never stuck with it tho. I think I got this one in 2002.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-jKwafHqzVCk/Tg8vQLPW10I/AAAAAAAAJi8/y0u-2j_xFpg/s400/IMG_20110702_154436.jpg" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My last walkman.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-qlhXNX_2wPo/Tg8vgBWE0FI/AAAAAAAAJjA/PDxDetEsk4c/s400/IMG_20110702_154538.jpg" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /></p>
<p>So there you have it. Nothing massively out of the ordinary but still feels odd putting them away. I wonder when my HTC Desire, Kindle and EeePC 701 will have the same fate?</p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;Android Running Perfectly on an EeePC Netbook. Totally Mad.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>This just totally blew me away. I grabbed the ISO of <a href="http://www.android-x86.org/">Android X86</a>, &ldquo;burned&rdquo; it onto USB stick, booted it on an ancient 700Mhz EeepC 701 Surf and 5 minutes after the initial download, it was running. Almost flawlessly.</p>
<p>Only issues I&rsquo;ve run into so far are Wifi giving a bit of grief (LAN fine) and some text entry playing silly buggers. There is also no Android Market but there are ways around that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-jtOZODsX1bo/TgstReJUu7I/AAAAAAAAJe8/qRm7OVS-3_U/s400/IMG_20110629_144553.jpg" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /></p>
<p>The amazing thing is the speed. The EeePC absolutely flies with Android and this is on a &ldquo;Live USB&rdquo;, it should be even faster if I do a full SSD install. Also using a touchpad actually works fine and the lack of touchscreen doesn&rsquo;t feel odd. It really makes me wonder what the point of the Chromebook is.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-HVIeMB0EATs/TgstGzk58RI/AAAAAAAAJe0/XtewWm_iiOk/s400/IMG_20110629_144603.jpg" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if you have an old Netbook on which Windows crawls and Linux is just not your cup of tea, try this out. YouTube, GMail, everything works fine. I think I&rsquo;ll be handing this old machine over to one of the younger kids as soon as I suss the Flash situation.</p>

<p>Google has announced <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/06/update-on-google-health-and-google.html">they are winding down Google Health</a>. I&#39;m terribly disappointed by this as I really thought they had something visionary there. <p /><div>I wrote this piece last year:<a href="http://conoroneill.com/2010/09/05/google-health-android-cardiotrainer-has-me-excited/">Google Health + Android + CardioTrainer has me excited</a></div><p /> <div>Coincidentally, Erick Schonfeldover on TechCrunch,<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/03/keas-bosworth-game-healthy/">interviewedthe creator of Google Health</a>, Adam Bosworth, a few weeks back. He said that the reason it never took off was that</div> <p /><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0.8ex; border-left-width: 1px; border-left-color: rgb(204, 204, 204); border-left-style: solid; padding-left: 1ex;"> Google Health never asked, What could they do that people would want? Instead. they basically offerd a place to store data. People dont want to store data, they want to have fun.</blockquote><p /><div>Hmm, I agree that the lack of any &quot;doing&quot; on the data was an issue but I&#39;m not convinced Social and Fun have any place in my core medical data. I wanted doctors, hospitals, pharmacies etc all filling the data there for me so there was one place for everything. <i>Then</i>, do something with the data. I never want to &quot;check-in&quot; to my pharmacy or become mayor of my liver.</div> <p /><div>I see a bigger fundamental problem here: Google didn&#39;t get buy-in from the data providers. They failed to build the relationships. If you look at Google TV, you see a very similar problem. And if you look at the new Google Music service, the same. Until Google addresses this problem, which is oddly similar to their Social problem, many of these initiatives are going to fail. I&#39;d be interested to see, for example, how many audio device manufacturers they have reached out to since they announced <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/usb/adk.html">Open Accessory</a>. But then Android is the shining example of how Google can knock it out of the park when working within anexistingecosystem.</div></p>

<p><p>With that one line by Alan Sugar on last night&rsquo;s UK Apprentice, I finally realised why Amstrad was never able to grow beyond the odd burst of short term opportunism into a global company. I&rsquo;d like to run a few numbers past Lord Sugar:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Number of Amstrad Music Devices sold last year: 0</li>
<li>Number of Apple Music Devices sold last year: 84m&nbsp;</li>
<li>Market share of phones with e-m@ailer technology: 0%</li>
<li>Market share of phones with ARM technology: 98% globally</li>
<li>Dell market cap: $30.18B</li>
<li> Viglen valuation: &pound;9.99?</li>
<li>Amstrad sale price: &pound;127m</li>
<li>Scientific Atlanta Sale Price: $6.9B</li>
</ul>
<div>The one difference between those companies and Amstrad? Great business people with a global vision working with great engineers with business sense.</div>
<p />
<div>So Lord Sugar, the next time an engineer runs a business or product idea past you, maybe stop thinking about how you can bundle a tape-recorder with it, and listen to her.</div>
</div>
<p />
<div>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be great if the BBC dropped property developer Alan from the Apprentice and replaced him with&nbsp;Herman Hauser&nbsp;who, with the creation of the BBC Micro, is ultimately responsible for what became ARM, a technology that is in nearly every mobile phone on the planet? That&rsquo;s someone I would like my kids to aspire to emulating.</div>
<p />
<div>Herman, by the way, is a Fellow of The Royal Academy of Engineering.</div></p>
