<p>Or maybe Apple bought them and they are re-branding to iFacebook for today&rsquo;s iPad Quad-Cam Turbo launch.</p>

<p>Really happy for the MIT team, they&rsquo;ve done a great job getting <a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/">App Inventor</a> moved whilst nailing a bunch of annoying bugs. It now works on Internet Explorer too, which was a major pain point for us in our kids&rsquo; school.</p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;BBC iPlayer Global on iPad - Nice App if you need it&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was contacted recently by a Social Media Agency working on the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/ie/app/bbc-iplayer-global/id449130604?mt=8">BBC iPlayer Global</a> project. They were interested in my thoughts on the iPlayer and very kindly gave me a month free on the iPad.</p>

<p><a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/mzl.gzwgeaff.480x480-75.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-614 aligncenter" title="mzl.gzwgeaff.480x480-75" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/mzl.gzwgeaff.480x480-75.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="351" /></a></p>

<p>As regular readers know, I seem to spend more time trying to create the perfect TV viewing setup than actually watching the telly, so of course I was interested in trying it out.</p>

<p>iPlayer Global is the BBC&rsquo;s very welcome move to make their programming available online globally. As with many of these services, it has free shows and a premium version with monthly 6.99 sub.</p>

<p>One thing I didn&rsquo;t realise initially is that it is iPad only. Whilst I totally understand that, it really needs to get on as many platforms as possible quickly. The issue isn&rsquo;t the lack of iPad users, it&rsquo;s that even those who own one don&rsquo;t necessarily always want to watch TV on one. (I see it is actually now available for iPhone too. Same comment applies tho).</p>

<p>iPlayer need to be like Netflix and be available on <em>everything</em>. I&rsquo;m very close to buying a $49 Roku box which would be perfect for it.</p>

<p>Over the few weeks I used the App several times and was highly impressed with the technical delivery of the product. The UI is very slick and it was easy to find and play shows. Social Sharing is a smidge unintuitive but that&rsquo;s just nit-picking. I also had very few streaming problems unlike that steaming pile of crap that is the Sky iPad App.</p>

<p>However its killer feature is the fact that you can download for playback later. This makes it perfect for travelling. It isimpossibleto stream anything on train journeys inIrelandso this is a godsend.</p>

<p>Having said that, I don&rsquo;t think Ireland is a particularly appropriate market. We can all get all of the BBC channels on Freesat, Sky and even on Freeview in the border counties. We can PVR them and sideload them onto mobile devices. Many of the popular shows are re-broadcast by RTE etc. I would be very surprised if more than a tiny percentage of people here sign up for it. Maybe those who travel a lot?</p>

<p>Thinking outside of Ireland, I can imagine a huge audience of people who either love individual BBC shows or have strong ties to the UK e.g. India, Pakistan, Bangladesh etc. Obviously the strength of BBC America means it&rsquo;ll be a big hit over there.</p>

<p>Of course it suffers from the same annoyance as Netflix where you can get only certain shows or older seasons of certain shows. All to keep the BBC&rsquo;s existing distribution partners happy everywhere.Will we ever see a time where every show is available to everyone globally simultaneously based on how much they are willing to pay? Let&rsquo;s keep fighting to make that happen.</p>

<p>Overall, iPlayer Global is a winner. Will I sign up for a sub in West Cork? No, but if I move to Half Moon Bay, I&rsquo;ll sign up right away.</p>

<p>Just to be sure I&rsquo;m not living in a middle-class fantasyland, it&rsquo;d be great to get as many people from as many backgrounds as possible to answer this poll. I know I know, if you are on Facebook/Twitter, it&rsquo;s already skewing it badly, but let&rsquo;s give it a go.</p>

<p>Basically I want to confirm that <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> with its HDMI video output is inclusive for the majority of people in UK/Ireland. Yes, it has Composite-out too but you&rsquo;d go blind trying to use that for anything except watching videos.</p>

<p>Interesting sidenote - Radionics now showing an ad on Google for it when you search for Raspberry Pi. Nice one.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve written before about how Lego Mindstorms is ridiculously overpriced. Whilst the intent was probably good, it is so far from the brilliance of cheap educational plastic blocks that they need to start again.</p>

<p>I love the idea of building robotics kits and teaching kids about basic programming in the process. In theory I&rsquo;m also a big fan of MIT App Inventor having Mindstorms integration but the problem is price. The kids who could benefit most from the opportunities presented by these learning tools are the ones least likely to be able to afford them.</p>

<p>But now we have Raspberry Pi. Something most people, even in a recession, can afford.</p>

<p>Raspberry Pi + Mindstorms Control Logic + App Inventor for 50. Change education forever. Do it.</p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;I never knew reCAPTCHA was used to help digitize old books&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yesterday on Twitter I jokingly suggested that Facebook&rsquo;s CAPTCHA had a &ldquo;sure that&rsquo;s close enough&rdquo; setting since there was no way I&rsquo;d guessed the second word correctly. Then two people pointed out that the second word was optional. I was gobsmacked. Years of hitting refresh until I got a word I could read, followed by the stress of guesssing, wasted!</p>

<p>This morning <a href="http://twitter.com/jkeyes">John Keyes</a> put us straight. Any site using <a href="http://www.google.com/recaptcha">reCAPTCHA</a> is actually helping to <a href="http://www.google.com/recaptcha/learnmore">digitize old books</a>. The first word in each pair is known but the second is from a scan of an old book where they don&rsquo;t know the word. If you guess first word correctly then there is a good chance you guessed the second one too. So they now have that second word scanned. I assume each word is given to multiple people to get a consensus.</p>

<p>What a simple but brilliant idea. From now on I&rsquo;m gonna do my best on that second word but without the stress.</p>
