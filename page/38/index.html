 <p>$80 is a steal. My biggest takeaway from Google IO was Open Accessory. The importance of it was missed by all the web ninjas. I fully expect to see companies like PCH delivering on products using this standard in 2011.</p></div>

<p>As you probably know, Facebook are transitioning over to https for security reasons. You can opt-in now but it will be mandatory in the coming months. I&#39;ve already written about the fact that every App developer will have to get an SSL cert but I discovered a bigger problem yesterday. <p /><div>If you are running the old Facebook Connect code on your site (and based on my experience, that&#39;s a <em>lot</em> of sites), you are probably accessing this URL:</div><p /><div><a href="http://apps.new.facebook.com/js/api_lib/v0.4/FeatureLoader.js.php">http://apps.new.facebook.com/js/api_lib/v0.4/FeatureLoader.js.php</a></div> <p /><div>Facebook now re-directs that to:</div><p /><div><a href="https://apps.new.facebook.com/js/api_lib/v0.4/FeatureLoader.js.php">https://apps.new.facebook.com/js/api_lib/v0.4/FeatureLoader.js.php</a></div> <p /><div>But their security Cert is only valid for *.<a href="http://facebook.com">facebook.com</a> not <em>.</em>.<a href="http://facebook.com">facebook.com</a> so Firefox 4 and Chrome 12 are refusing to access it and therefore disabling Facebook Connect on your site.</div> <p /><div>Whilst everyone <em>should</em> move to the new Graph API, not everyone has the time/money/resources to get it done. Hopefully Facebook can fix this soon and give sites more time to transition to the newer code.</div></p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;Bye Bye Boxee (for now)&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;ve been a <a href="http://www.boxee.tv/">Boxee</a> fanatic since I first installed it over two years ago. We had been running <a href="http://xbmc.org/">XBMC</a> on several old XBOXes (and still do) but they couldn&rsquo;t handle x.264 video or HDMI so when I built a media PC, I used Boxee. I am absolutely convinced their focus on social is the right way to go. Social watching of TV in 2011 is barely scratching the surface of what&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p />
<div>But Brooklyn, we have a problem. Development on the non-Boxee-Box codebase has ground to a halt. All of their efforts are now on the Boxee Box. And rightly so. When you have VC investment, your job is to generate a return, not bug-fix free code for geeks. Particularly when you are a small team, you have to prioritise revenue generation.</div>
<p />
<div>We did some moving around of PCs recently with the result that the media PC is now running Ubuntu 10.10 x86-64 instead of Windows. I happily did this in the knowledge that there was a Boxee installer for this setup. What I had forgotten was what a pain in the ass it is to do anything with video and decent video cards on Linux. Then I found that Boxee crashed trying to play any video. Argghhh.</div>
<p />
<div>In parallel to this I discovered that XBMC (the code that Boxee is based on) had been in heavy development on PCs over the past few years. It has versions for Windows and Ubuntu too. I was forced to give it a go due to the Boxee problems and was pleasantly surprised to find that it&rsquo;s very good indeed (apart from the 1980s Amstrad twin-tape-deck shiny black colour scheme).&nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>A few video glitches on XBMC made me try the ATI-AMD proprietary video driver instead of the OpenSource one. It didn&rsquo;t solve the XBMC pause-restart glitch but it did make Boxee work. In black and white :-(</div>
<p />
<div>I then tried a nightly build of XBMC and wow! All of the TV show preview stuff is brilliant, including episode synopses. Development is obviously moving ahead quickly.</div>
<p />
<div>I continue to recommend Boxee Boxes to anyone who asks me about media centres but I don&rsquo;t have $200 spare to buy something that I can already do via the media PC. Hopefully the Boxee guys will sort out the Ubuntu problems at some point and then I&rsquo;ll be back. But for now, XBMC it is.</div></p>

<p>I have used the same basic document layout since I first wrote a school project on a giant ICL dedicated word processor in my Dad&#39;s office in 1985. The same layout through Wordperfect 5.1, Word for MSDOS, Word for Windows v1.0-2007, OpenOffice/LibreOffice and Google Docs. <p /><div>I bet you use the same layout:</div><div><ol><li>Title Page</li><li>Table of Contents</li><li>Section 1 (with header and footer on all following pages)</li><li>Section 1.1</li><li>Section 1.1.1</li><li> Section 2</li><li>&hellip;</li><li>&hellip;</li><li>&hellip;</li><li>Section N</li><li>Section N.n</li></ol><div>Why then, after 26 years does Microsoft/Google/Sun/Oracle give us a bloody blank template? The template we <em>all</em> use is not even an option in any of them. Clippy never once said: &quot;Oh I see you are trying to write a document with the same structure as everyone else on the planet, will I create a non-tacky template for you?&quot;.</div> </div><p /><div>By far the worst is OpenOffice/LibreOffice. You have to manually create a numbering structure from scratch to get 1, 1.1 etc on your headings. In 2011. Seriously.</div><p /><div>And no LibreOffice, when I hit carriage return at the end of a section heading line, I don&#39;t want another line with section heading formatting, I want body-text FFS.</div> <p /><div>And no Google Docs, when I cut some bullet points and try to paste them further down in the bullet list, I don&#39;t want to randomly indent them, I&#39;m trying to bloody move them.</div><p /> <div>This is basic basic basic stuff. Anyone want to write a word processor that actually works the way humans do?</div></p>

                        <p>#&ldquo;21st Century Milkman&rdquo;</p>

<p>We&#39;ve recently started using a new milkman after a many year gap and I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about him. Back in the late 80s and early 90s, the co-ops/creameries basically shut down the in-house milkmen and many of them became independent businesses. I had thought it would be a slow inexorable death for them because of price-competition from the big supermarkets. We stopped using the one in Kimmage in the mid-90s because our milk demands were so variable and he only delivered on certain days. <p /><div>Then this new guy appeared in Bandon and I realised that he&#39;s not really a milkman, he&#39;s a local delivery man. I think that type of business could have a big future. His core problem, the fact that his milk is wayyyy more expensive than Tesco, is mitigated by all the other things he does and could do. He offers multiple types of milk, eggs, juice and now the Saturday paper. We&#39;ve signed up for the lot. He recently announced we can pay by EFT!</div> <p /><div>But this could just be the start. Imagine if he was fully web, SMS and mobile-app enabled? Then add Realex/Worldpay and PayPal. Whatever you needed, within reason, you could order from him, with maybe 6-8 hours notice. Imagine if he didn&#39;t just deliver early in the morning but combined that with a slot system like Tesco for later in the day?</div> <p /><div>People happily pay through the nose for the convenience of a local Spar/Centra/etc vs Tesco prices. Surely they would pay for even more convenience to have things delivered to their door? Hell, he could even buy the stuff in Tesco and still get margin if he was more flexible than them.</div> <p /><div>Could it be, dare I say it, a workable Webvan model?</div></p>

<p><p>With every new release of Skype it gets slower and slower and buggier and buggier. But that&rsquo;s not the worst of it. I pay them for both inbound numbers and for a lot of call charges. Yet every damned morning when I get up, this stupid message greets me.</p>
<p />
<div>And that&rsquo;s after un-ticking all of the &ldquo;of course I want you to try and sell me more shit&rdquo; boxes.</div>
<p />
<div>I&rsquo;d move to another solution but so many people I communicate with use it now for the free Skype-to-Skype, so I can&rsquo;t.&nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>And they obviously know that.</div>

<p>I re-set up a PC last week and installed all of my most-used apps. The list gets shorter and shorter each year as I move everything online. Here&#39;s a snapshot of the bulk of them (MS Office implied of course). </p></p>
