It's a particular problem on the Raspberry Pi or small DigitalOcean Droplets. In many cases a simple SQLite DB or TingoDB is more than sufficient. Here's some notes on using them. </description><pubDate>Sun, 20 Sep 2015 12:03:54 GMT</pubDate><link>http://conoroneill.net//tingodb-and-sqlite-instead-of-mongodb-and-mysql-for-tiny-projects-or-raspberry-pi</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://conoroneill.net//tingodb-and-sqlite-instead-of-mongodb-and-mysql-for-tiny-projects-or-raspberry-pi</guid></item><item><title>Running ZeroMQ with Node.js on Raspberry Pi</title><description>ZeroMQ is a lightweight messaging library and looks ideal for lower powered devices like the RPi. Building and running is pretty easy. These are more notes for myself for future reference.</description><pubDate>Sun, 20 Sep 2015 10:38:46 GMT</pubDate><link>http://conoroneill.net//running-zeromq-with-node-js-on-raspberry-pi</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://conoroneill.net//running-zeromq-with-node-js-on-raspberry-pi</guid></item><item><title>TIL you can import 3D models from Tinkercad to Minecraft. How cool is that?</title><description>WE had US visitors last weekend and the kids loved my Printrbot 3D printer. They had learned Tinkercad in school so that's what they used to create things and print them out. I noticed a &quot;Download to Minecraft&quot; option and finally just had a chance to try it out. Wow!</description><pubDate>Sun, 23 Aug 2015 13:42:32 GMT</pubDate><link>http://conoroneill.net//til-you-can-import-3d-models-from-tinkercad-to-minecraft-how-cool-is-that</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://conoroneill.net//til-you-can-import-3d-models-from-tinkercad-to-minecraft-how-cool-is-that</guid></item><item><title>Creating an OTP fob compatible with Google Authenticator using an Espruino Pico</title><description>Now that the Espruino Pico has (beta) HID support, it can pretend to be a keyboard or mouse (or other HID compatible device). This makes it possible to send characters to the active window on your Windows/Linux/Mac PC. I've cobbled together some code which turns the Pico into a device like a YubiKey.

Now one of their few bright lights of the past decade is biting the dust. However some very very smart person wrote some code two years ago which you may find useful. It converts your Pipes to Node.js apps.</description><pubDate>Sat, 06 Jun 2015 14:06:15 GMT</pubDate><link>http://conoroneill.net//save-your-yahoo-pipes-as-nodejs-apps-for-posterity</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://conoroneill.net//save-your-yahoo-pipes-as-nodejs-apps-for-posterity</guid></item></channel></rss>
