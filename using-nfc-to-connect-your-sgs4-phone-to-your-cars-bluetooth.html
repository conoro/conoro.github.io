<p>I&#39;ve been wanting to play with NFC for ages so when I got an SGS4 recently, my chance finally came. I ordered a pack of 10 stickers from <a href="http://www.shop4nfc.com/product-details/NTAG203-type-2-nfc-tags-shop4nfc">Shop4NFC.com</a> in China for $8.99 and they arrived about a week later.</p>
<p>To try them out, I installed the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jwsoft.nfcactionlauncher&amp;hl=en">NFC Task Launcher</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsIm5ldC5kaW5nbGlzY2guYW5kcm9pZC50YXNrZXJtIl0.">Tasker</a> Apps. The former enables you to do things like change Wifi settings, volume, display, sync email or even Tweet when it detects a configured NFC sticker. One of the most common use cases is for people to have a sticker at work which puts the phone on mute when you lay the phone on top of it.</p>
<p>Tasker is a general automation app that is not reliant on NFC and can do a ton of different complex things based on context and actions. The reason I installed it is that it can do more complex stuff with Bluetooth than NFC Task Launcher.</p>
<p>I was really disappointed to discover that Bluetooth on the SGS4 is as buggy and glitchy as every other Android phone I&#39;ve owned. Google&#39;s announcement at I/O yesterday that they are going to improve things this year doesn&#39;t convince me. They&#39;ve had 4 years to get it right. The fact that they broke access to Wiimotes etc in 4.2 tells you just how bad they are at Bluetooth.</p>
<p>The place where this causes me the most grief is in the car. All I want is for the bloody phone to auto-connect over A2DP to my Lidl Car stereo when the car is on so I can play my podcasts and listen to music. In theory the SGS4 can do this but simply fails to, 9 times out of 10. HTC&#39;s Android was similarly bad. AOSP/Cyanogen in some versions worked perfectly but it was a crapshoot whether any version would work or not.</p>
<p><a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/nfc.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1041" alt="nfc" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/nfc.jpg" width="500" height="707" /></a></p>
<p>So I thought NFC might solve this. Rather than letting Android itself auto-connect, use Tasker to force a connection. And whaddya know, it seems to work. I tap the phone off the sticker after I turn on the ignition and it connects over Bluetooth to the car stereo. It&#39;s only failed once in 10 and I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s because I didn&#39;t hold the phone to the sticker long enough.</p>
<p>Actually, that&#39;s really the only downside of NFC that I&#39;ve seen so far. A swipe or momentary tap is not good enough, it requires a very distinct touch and hold for a moment before the tag powers up and sends its ID info to the phone. You can tell by the audio cue on the SGS4 whether it worked or not.</p>
<p>Now I need to find uses for the other 9 stickers. Suggestions?</p>
