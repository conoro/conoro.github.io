      <description>&lt;p&gt;#&amp;ldquo;VS Day - Victory Over Sky Day. Free at last etc etc yadda yadda&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After our ongoing argument over the telephone connection with Sky TV, they doubled the multi-room charge, so we cancelled the lot in early August.Today the cancellation finally kicked in.&lt;p /&gt;&lt;div&gt;The kids are in shock. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p /&gt;&lt;div&gt;We had planned to get a Freesat box but we&amp;#39;re actually going to play it by ear and get nothing for a while. Let&amp;#39;s see how they survive on the few stations they can get in &amp;quot;Other Channels&amp;quot; on the Sky box, along with BBC iPlayer, Hulu and YouTube.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p /&gt;&lt;div&gt;I would say RTE Player too, but we don&amp;#39;t watch RTE in our house except for the odd food show once every six months.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p /&gt;&lt;div&gt;Biggest holes are probably going to be Wizards of Waverly Place and Hannah Montana.The younger ones will be happy enough with CBeebies (by whatever route).&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p /&gt;&lt;div&gt;I still want to get a HBO subscription. Some day the US TV stations will figure all of this internet stuff out and put Rupert out of business.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p /&gt;&lt;div&gt;I&amp;#39;ll report back after a week or so.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
