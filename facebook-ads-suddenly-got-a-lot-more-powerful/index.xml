      <description>&lt;p&gt;#&amp;ldquo;Facebook Ads suddenly got a lot more powerful&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;posterous_bookmarklet_entry&#34;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;posterous_short_quote&#34;&gt;So when you click the new Like Facebook button, being very helpful and all, Facebook will update your permanent profile with your new like.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;posterous_quote_citation&#34;&gt;via &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eddale.co/general/facebook-bombshell-how-did-everyone-miss-this-facebook-f8&#34;&gt;eddale.co&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still digesting all of the announcements from Facebook&amp;rsquo;s F8 conference yesterday. Lots of brilliant stuff in there which has me excited. Interesting contrast to the catastrophe that was Google Buzz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is some work for us to switch from Facebook Connect by the looks of things but no biggie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post from Ed Dale is incredibly important and I have to admit I missed the key news too. The new Facebook &amp;ldquo;Like&amp;rdquo; buttons, that you can expect to see everywhere very soon, do something which increases the value of Facebook as an Ad platform by several orders of magnitude. They update your profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like everyone else, I thought it was a Wall thing (and question whether people want their Wall to be a long list of product/site pimpages). But the buttonsd actually update your permanent profile that you filled out initially (interests/likes etc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when those of us who do Ads on Facebook want to demographically target people, we now have up-to-date detailed information based on your explicit recent &amp;ldquo;Like&amp;rdquo; activity, not the few interests (&amp;ldquo;Music&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Hummus&amp;rdquo;) you thought of two years ago when you joined Facebook or when you clicked &amp;ldquo;Skip&amp;rdquo; during that part of the sign-up process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a very very very powerful change and if I was the Google AdWords team, I would now be officially soiling myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read the rest of Ed&amp;rsquo;s post for more detail and thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
