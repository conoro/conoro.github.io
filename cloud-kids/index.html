It&#39;s a solid setup and they are happy with it. However, as it was a self-build, it never had a Windows licence and actually runs Ubuntu Linux.</p><p> I&#39;ve always found it interesting that the kids could switch from XP to Windows 7 to Ubuntu on different PCs and laptops without comment. The reason of course is that they spend their entire time in the web browser. The old days of installing &quot;educational software&quot; from CD are long gone. It&#39;s YouTube, Wikipedia, Nick Jr, Disney Playhouse, Webkinz etc etc. Everyone from the 3 y/o to the 10 y/o has that stuff mastered.<p> However I find myself in one-time-only agreement with Steve Jobs on a particular topic and that&#39;s Flash. Either Adobe figures out how to improve its performance by 10x and reduce it&#39;s resource hit by a similar amount or it&#39;ll go the way of Wordperfect within two years.<p> Flash is a general resource pig on Windows but it renders Linux boxes unusable. Open three browser tabs on sites that have Flash-heavy ads and watch your dual-core machine grind to a halt.<p>As a matter of principle I don&#39;t disable ads in my browser. People have to make a living and that&#39;s how many of them do. But I&#39;m afraid, as of last week, I have turned on Adblock Plus on my Linux boxes. The results are astounding. Suddenly my browser is usable again. I can race through Google Reader and open 100 tabs with minimal slowdown. But on principle, I will tweak the filters soon to only block Flash ads and let through the text and image based ones.<p> An hour ago I did the same on the kids&#39; Linux box. Again, an incredible change. All those Flash-riddled sites are now fairly usable with the Flash ads turned off and the CPU dedicated to playing the game(s) on the sites.<p> So Adobe is now responsible for reducing their customers&#39; revenue by forcing people to disable functionality. <p>I think we are going to see a fast and massive switchover from Flash for ads and kids&#39; sites to HTML5+h.264 in the coming 12 months with that switchover led by The Steve. I&#39;m really not sure how Adobe can prevent it except through FUD or a complete screwup of cross-browser cross-platform compatibility in HTML5.<section class="comments"><h2>Discuss</h2><div id="disqus_thread"><script>var disqus_shortname = 'crossdominant';
