      <description>&lt;p&gt;#&amp;ldquo;Experimental GIMP for Windows in Single-Window Mode&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gimp.org/&#34;&gt;GIMP&lt;/a&gt; for all of our basic bitmap manipulations. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s changing the colour of stars or modifying logos for Facebook Connect, it gets the job done brilliantly. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried many others like Paint.net and nothing comes close. But as anyone who has used it knows, they have had that horrible multi-window setup for years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went looking earlier to see if there had been any progress on GIMP in general. I read a scathing post a good while back basically saying RIP GIMP since it was still only able to do 8-bit colour depth. But after a bit of searching I found that things have been moving along, albeit very slowly. The new versions sounded fab but the official site didn&amp;rsquo;t have any of them for Windows. A bit more searching and I found some &lt;a href=&#34;http://graphicall.org/351&#34;&gt;experimental builds&lt;/a&gt; including one for Windows 7 64-bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/gimp.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone size-large wp-image-602&#34; title=&#34;gimp&#34; src=&#34;https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/gimp-1024x722.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;584&#34; height=&#34;411&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so far, it&amp;rsquo;s working great! Single-Window Mode yay.&lt;/p&gt;
