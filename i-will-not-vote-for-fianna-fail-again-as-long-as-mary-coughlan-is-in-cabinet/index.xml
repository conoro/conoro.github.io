      <description>&lt;p&gt;#&amp;ldquo;I will not vote for Fianna Fail again as long as Mary Coughlan is in cabinet&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;posterous_bookmarklet_entry&#34;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;posterous_medium_quote&#34;&gt;Ryanair has claimed that the Government&amp;rsquo;s refusal to upset the DAA by considering an application from the budget airline led it to open a maintenance facility in Prestwick, Scotland with the creation of 200 jobs.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;posterous_quote_citation&#34;&gt;via &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2010/0215/breaking27.htm&#34;&gt;irishtimes.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course a lot of this particular story is Ryanair spin but Mary Couglan is simply not competent as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and is an active impediment to the economic recovery of this country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She is not in possession of the background, knowledge, skills or aptitude to have this portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She leaves a trail of embarrassments, gaffes and diplomatic near-incidents every time she speaks in front of foreign companies or dignitaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian Cowen is putting personal friendship and political alliances before the good of the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
