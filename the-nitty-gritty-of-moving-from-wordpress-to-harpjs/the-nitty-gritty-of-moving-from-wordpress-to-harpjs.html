                        <p>As I said in the previous posts, the move from WP to HarpJS was not exactly smooth. But I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;ve done it as I finally learned how to use a lot of things like Jade that I&rsquo;ve long-fingered for years.</p>

<p>The first step was to get the original content out of WordPress. This had the added twist that the conoroneill.net blog actually started out as a Posterous blog which I imported into WordPress when I realised that Posterous was a dead-end. So the first two years of posts have some &ldquo;interesting&rdquo; problems in them.</p>

<p>The tool I used for import was <a href="https://github.com/EJEHardenberg/wpJson4Harp">wpJson4Harp</a> as recommended on the HarpJS site. These were the notes I took on that part of the process:</p>

<ul>
<li>It doesn&rsquo;t work off a WXR export or WP APIs but actually needs access to your WordPress DB. This is not a goer if you have shared hosting with the MySQL access locked down. I had to dump my WP DB and load it into a VirtualBox Ubuntu VM and run the import tool there.</li>
<li>As I mentioned above, the older Posterous posts had problems

<ul>
<li>Lots of embedded YouTube Videos not working</li>
<li>I was gutted to discover that the Posterous to WP import had not moved over the images. So now that Posterous is gone, so are those images. A harsh lesson learned. I&rsquo;m just imagining how exposed the average Tumblr person is to the same problem</li>
<li>Posterous seemed to use 4 spaces in formatting quite a bit. So of course Harp thinks this is source code in the generated MD files and formats appropriately. I manually did a search/replace on this to convert all sets of 4 spaces to 1. Seems to have done the trick</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve been using a YouTube plugin which lets me embed videos by using a fake url with the prefix httpv. None of these work. Probably won&rsquo;t be that hard to do a search/replace on those eventually.</li>
<li>The &ldquo;blog index&rdquo; file that wpJson4Harp generated (_data.json) is quite crude. It has JS timestamps rather than human readable ones and the posts are not in chronological order</li>
<li>I ended up making some changes to its Python source to simplify its output and make it more &ldquo;blog like&rdquo;</li>
<li>I downloaded all the files from wp-content in WordPress and uploaded them to my S3 account using Cloudberry Explorer. I then did a search replace across all of the MD files to replace my conoroneill.net URLs with <a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/">https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>So once I had all of the old blogposts as MD files, it was time to get them into some sort of HarpJS blog. I managed to install Harp on Windows after a lot of messing with Visual Studio Express (both 2010 and 2012 now installed) and node-sass. Actully node-saas just seems to be a general pain in the arse and I hope people start using something else that doesn&rsquo;t require native compilation.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, even tho Harp installed, it doesn&rsquo;t work correctly on Windows if you are using for GitHub Pages. It throws an error about bad paths if you do harp compile _harp ./</p>

<p>So I moved over to my Ubuntu VM and setup everything there instead. The <a href="http://harpjs.com/docs/deployment/github-pages">instructions for using GitHub Pages</a> as the host on the Harp site work perfectly for Ubuntu.</p>

<p>As Harp is pretty new, there are very few templates/themes for blogs. The general web-site ones seem good and I&rsquo;ll be trying them out after this. So I ended up using the Baseline template and that&rsquo;s where the heavy work began. Here&rsquo;s all the problems/challenges/learnings I went through over the space of several weekends:</p>

<ul>
<li>Template assumes /blog for blog but that&rsquo;s not what I use, I need it to be in the root. Some simple playing with the templates seemed to take care of that.</li>
<li>I didn&rsquo;t use year/month/day in my original URLs on Posterous (and then WordPress) so I now have 650 md files and html files in one directory each. I&rsquo;ll move to date based directories from now on, once I figure it out.</li>
<li>The default index.html (_layout.jade) just lists every post in the order it finds them in _data.json but that&rsquo;s completely un-blog-like. I had to implement a bunch of JavaScript in the Jade template to sort the posts by reverse chronological order. As I&rsquo;m not a JavaScript programmer, this ended up being several days of grabbing bits of code off Stack Overflow and sticking console.log in everywhere until I finally got it working. Learned a lot but it nearly ended up being a show-stopper and I came very close to giving up. You can see the main <a href="https://github.com/conoro/conoro.github.io/blob/master/_harp/_layout.jade">changes here</a> (don&rsquo;t laugh!)</li>
<li>As a result I realised that Jade is an extremely limited templating language. I can see why a lot of people use EJS instead. I had to drop to raw JavaScript to do most things e.g. converting the JS timestamps to human readable format</li>
<li>Stylus is a reasonably nice way of doing CSS but of course you can&rsquo;t use line numbers in Chrome Inspector to see what line in the Stylus template has to change. But the upside is that I know have a basic understanding of Stylus</li>
<li>I learned how to do Google Web Fonts which was neat</li>
<li>There is no pagination in the index.html template and I cannot find a &ldquo;recipe&rdquo; for this even in a wider Jade context.</li>
<li>I had to delete some references to Twitter etc in the templates as they kept causing Jade errors. I think it&rsquo;s some cross-referencing problem between author in _data.json and the config file for Twitter.</li>
<li>The home page should not be 650+ post titles, it should be 5-10 full posts, like a normal blog. I haven&rsquo;t got started on this yet but it will require cross referencing between _data.json and individual HTML/md files to pull in the content</li>
<li>The RSS feed did not validate for several reasons (JS timestamps, titles). I fixed that so it now validates. But like the home page, it only has my manually entered post summaries rather than my preferred approach of full posts.</li>
<li>The RSS feed was set to rss.xml but I changed to it to /feed so that existing subscribers to my WP blog don&rsquo;t all lose me in the move</li>
<li>The Disqus integration works well but ideally I&rsquo;d love an Open Source JS commenting system that stores comments in maybe JSON files on Dropbox</li>
<li>Google Analytics support and the avatar support for GitHub/Twitter/Facebook/G+ is nice.</li>
<li>There is obviously no search built in. Currently I&rsquo;m using Google Custom Search which works well but is fugly. Is there a possibility to create a simple JS search tool that uses _data.json as a first MVP and later builds a searchable JSON index file as part of the compile process?</li>
</ul>

<p>So I now have something that almost works the way I want it. Uploading images to S3 is no real strain and I&rsquo;ll be able to make all the other changes I want incrementally.</p>

<p>The biggest ongoing annoyance is that &ldquo;harp compile&rdquo; deletes all of the generated HTML and re-builds everything from scratch every time. This isn&rsquo;t scalable when you have 650+ posts and it means that when I add a new blogpost I have to wait 2-3 minutes for it to recompile. There should be an incremental option which assumes no structural/styling changes have happened and just looks for new md files to compile and then rebuilds index.html. Good old &ldquo;Make&rdquo; had this nailed a long time ago ;-) Actually cpould git not be leveraged for this? Compare the current working tree with the last commit?</p>

<p>That HTML deletion is also a problem for using a DNS CNAME with GitHub Pages since it deletes that file from the root directory every time. Update: OK, I just sorted this with two minutes effort. Created CNAME file in _harp and added it with layout: false to _data.json. The compile process then copies it over to root.</p>

<p>It would be great to have a simple cli tool called new-blog-post which asks for a title, date and summary and updates _data.json and creates the empty .md file. I could probably write this myself but I&rsquo;ve 500 other things I need to do too. I also must look into adding tagging and a ZX Spectrum header image.</p>

<p>I know the whole process sounds like a huge amount of work. It was! But I think everything above could be sorted with an improved WP import tool that works on WXR files and some kick-ass blog templates rather than web-site templates. I&rsquo;m really looking forward to using Harp when I port an old web-site next.</p>

<p>Update 1: I forgot to mention a few things:</p>

<p>First was Disqus itself. Adding it as a plugin and using the import feature there didn&rsquo;t work for comments. But importing the WXR file worked great and all old comments are now visible using Disqus.</p>

<p>Second was the actual switch from WP on Blacknight to GitHub Pages. This was a bit fiddly. I use an non-www domain and learned that you can&rsquo;t CNAME from conoroneill.net over to conoro.github.io. Luckily I use DNSMadeEasy for DNS and they have a feature called ANAME which does allow this. But before I turned that on, I had to move the WP blog elsewhere. This involved creating a new domain called conoroneillnet.conoroneill.com and associating it to the old WP install on Blacknight. Then I used the <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/automatic-domain-changer/">Automatic Domain Changer</a> plugin to reset everything in WP and its database to the new archive domain. Then finally I made the DNSMadeEasy change. And ta-daaaa, I&rsquo;m now on GitHub Pages. I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;ll take a while for the DNS changes to propagate. I&rsquo;ll now turn off Google indexing of the old blog to avoid duplicate content issues.</p>

<p>Update 2: Now that everything is moved, I&rsquo;ve just realised I have a very serious problem - trailing slashes, or more precisely, the lack of them. On WordPress all of my URLs ended with a trailing slash. By default, HarpJS doesn&rsquo;t since it treats / to mean directory not file. This wouldn&rsquo;t be so bad if there was a re-direct from one to the other, but there isn&rsquo;t, the URLs with trailing slashes give a 404. Which basically kills every existing inbound link to the blog (and messes up Disqus to boot). There is a way around it by putting every post in its own directory on that name and renaming every file to index.md. This seems like overkill when an auto-redirect really should be the default. Of course this is a <a href="http://garbagecollected.org/2013/02/27/wordpress-to-github-pages/">GitHub Pages issue</a> not a Harp issue. Not sure what I&rsquo;m going to do now&hellip;&hellip;</p>

<p>Update 3: As I want to avoid &ldquo;downtime&rdquo;, I bit the bullet and took the directory approach for all old posts. The new ones will be fine. This code did the trick (thanks Stack Overflow) in the _harp dir:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">
find . -name "*.md" -exec sh -c 'NEWDIR=`basename "$1" .md` ; mkdir "$NEWDIR" ; mv "$1" "index.md"; mv "index.md" "$NEWDIR" ' _ {} \;
</code></pre>

<p>Update 4: Damn and blast, I forgot about /feed not redirecting too. So I created a /feed directory and put the feed.jade file in there as index.jade and set layout to false in a new _data.json file in that directory (after trying 20 other things!).</p>
