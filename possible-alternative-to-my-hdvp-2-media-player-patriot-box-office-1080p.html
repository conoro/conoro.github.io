 <p>I&#39;ve written about the HDVP-2 before. It&#39;s a lovely compact powerful media player. It handles most video formats (unlike Apple TV and many phones which only handle MP4), is small, has HDMI-out and Composite out, plays 1080p, takes an internal HDD, has ethernet, USB, optional wifi and a remote.
</p><p>Overall it&#39;s been a great purchase except for a few things. First, it doesn&#39;t spin-down the internal HDD so you have to unplug when not using. Second, it has big AV sync issues with many AVIs and no ability to manually tweak whilst playing (unlike XBMC, Boxee etc). Third, the firmware updates are rare and finally, they seem to have stopped selling them!
</p><p>I see plenty of media players on sale even in local stores. Heck even Aldi are selling one this week. One big problem is that you generally have no idea of their capabilities, particularly when it comes to handling a wide range of formats. Many of them can only handle SD content too. Very few of them can stream wirelessly from your PC. Strangely the Aldi box has ethernet but not Wifi.
</p><p>I saw a mention on HDVP forums of a Patriot player and I did a search for it. I think it may make a very good alternative. It has all of the features I just listed for the HDVP-2. It only seems to be missing component video out which I never used anyway. The big advantage is that it is being sold by a large company and it is OEMed by several others so it should be supported for a long time to come. 
</p><p>I read a <a href="http://www.testfreaks.com/blog/review/review-of-patriot-box-office-media-player/">good review of it here</a>. The other useful thing is that they sell it on Amazon UK so it may even be deliverable to Ireland for free.
</p><p>My sis in law was looking for a media player recently. I told her the Boxee Box is by far the best. But it may be a stretch at the current price. This Patriot may be enough for her.</p></div>
