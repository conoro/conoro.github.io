      <description>&lt;p&gt;#&amp;ldquo;Harbour Hopping in West Cork - Apple uses Google Maps hand-me-downs&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve had much hilarity online today over the awfulness of Apple&amp;rsquo;s new iOS6 Maps. I finally just got it installed on the iPad and of course decided to check the local situation. Actually notdisastrous. The golf club is notlabelledas an airship landing strip for a start. But then I spotted something interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back about 6 years ago, Google Maps was completely useless in West Cork. At one point it seemed to think there was only one road down here, the N71. Andbizarrelyit wasn&amp;rsquo;t labelled as the N71, it was called &amp;ldquo;Harbour Hopping in South West Cork&amp;rdquo;. Seriously, that&amp;rsquo;s what Google thought the road was called. I never found out how such a ridiculous bug got into the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually Google re-mapped the country itself and bought some better data. Their maps around here are now pretty fantastic and Streetview even went up tiny one-car-wide lanes locally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So imagine my surprise when I saw this on the iPad:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/IMG_0431.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-858&#34; title=&#34;IMG_0431&#34; src=&#34;https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/IMG_0431.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;768&#34; height=&#34;1024&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to 2006 y&amp;rsquo;all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
