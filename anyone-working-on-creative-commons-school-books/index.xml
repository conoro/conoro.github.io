      <description>&lt;p&gt;#&amp;ldquo;Anyone working on Creative Commons School Books?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost of schoolbooks remains an enormous problem for a lot of people. If you have more than one child, you can rarely do hand-me-downs, particularly in Secondary School. The publishers relentlessly issue new versions that are different enough to make it impossible to have multiple editions in one classroom.&lt;p /&gt;&lt;div&gt;Given that Maths, History, English, Irish, Physics etc, don&amp;#39;t actually change much except with curriculum changes, does it not make sense for community-minded Irish educators to work together and generate Creative Commons versions of books? Or is it only we geeks who do things like that?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
