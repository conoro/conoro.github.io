 <p>Dearest HBO, I love your programmes. In fact I love them so much I'd be willing to pay you so I can watch them in Ireland even tho I can get many of them at a later point for "free" from Irish and UK TV networks (aka TV Licence + SKY Subscription).
</p><p>Don't you want my money?
</p><p>Man up. Do a deal with Boxee. Get *GLOBAL* per-show subscription based watching (direct download not live IPTV) set-up with them and you'll have joined the 21st Century in one simple step.
</p><p>If you have geo-exclusivity deals with disties or networks, then add a clause to cover downloads in each new contract that comes up for negotiation.
</p><p>How many times does this shit have to be spelled out for you?</p></div>
