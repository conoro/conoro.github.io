#"Poll - Do you have an LCD/Plasma TV with HDMI?"

Just to be sure I'm not living in a middle-class fantasyland, it'd be great to get as many people from as many backgrounds as possible to answer this poll. I know I know, if you are on Facebook/Twitter, it's already skewing it badly, but let's give it a go.

Basically I want to confirm that <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> with its HDMI video output is inclusive for the majority of people in UK/Ireland. Yes, it has Composite-out too but you'd go blind trying to use that for anything except watching videos.

Interesting sidenote - Radionics now showing an ad on Google for it when you search for Raspberry Pi. Nice one.
