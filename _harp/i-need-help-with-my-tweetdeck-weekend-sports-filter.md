#"I need help with my Tweetdeck Weekend Sports Filter"


 <p>I'm working on the best combination of words for a global filter in Tweetdeck to remove Tweets about stuff I don't care about.</p>
<p />
<div>Of course, of most importance is the Weekend Sports filter.</div>
<p />
<div>I've started with:
<div>
<ul>
<li>soccer</li>
<li>football</li>
<li>game</li>
<li>score</li>
<li>c'mon you</li>
<li>liverpool</li>
<li>utd</li>
<li>chelsea</li>
<li>man u</li>
<li>rugby</li>
<li>golf</li>
<li> putt</li>
<li>tiger woods</li>
<li>various russian names</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p />
<div>What else should I add in there to have a Sports-Free Twitter Weekend?</div>
</div>
<p />
<div>
<div>I've been saying for two years that Twitter applications need a powerful filter system. I even specced an App built on that concept. I'm stunned all the big players are dicking around with rubbish like Buzz integration rather than addressing a massive user need, noise removal.</div>
</div>
