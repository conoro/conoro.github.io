#"How do you get your Irish web business news?"


 <p>Just had a conversation with our VP of Sales (to be announced soon :-)) about how people in Ireland working in web-related businesses get their industry business news. So not the latest web-app announcement or gadget but the business side of things. Who is selling what where. Who is doing new marketing campaigns. Who is doing deals with who. But specific to Ireland.</p>
<p>Is it still the business and technology sections of newspapers? Are there niche&nbsp;publications? Or has it all moved online? If you have a sec, can you let me know below? I figure this information is useful to us all.</p>
<p>Hmm, doesn't look like I can embed a Polldaddy poll here, so a link will have to do.</p>
