 <blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">TechCrunch TV will go live next month. Broadcasting online (and soon possibly elsewhere) 24 hours a day, the channels focus will be on the people behind the stories you read on TC every day: the entrepreneurs, developers, venture capitalists, angels and assorted geniuses who are building companies from Silicon Valley to Serbia and beyond.</blockquote>
