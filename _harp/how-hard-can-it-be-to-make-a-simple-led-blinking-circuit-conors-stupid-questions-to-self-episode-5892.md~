# How hard can it be to make a simple LED blinking circuit? Conor's stupid questions to self, Episode 5892

Last night after a few glasses of vino, I decided to make a simple blinking LED circuit but I didn't want to involve Arduinos, just discrete components.

Most of that auld internet does them with 555 timers but I don't have any of those so much googling ensued. I finally found one and tried to make it, learning in the process that soldering and Sauvignon Blanc don't mix:

To be fair, the LED lit, it just wouldn't blinking blink.

I've written several times before about how an infamous lecturer in UCD put me off analogue electronics almost for life, so after a bit a clueless fiddling I went to bed.

I tried again this morning and found what appeared to be <a href="https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/17998/ultra-low-power-simple-flashing-circuit">a nicer circuit </a>and I even had the right type of transistor:

A bit of fiddling later:

Next year I'll just buy a card in time!

I even did a video for the full blinktastic experience:
