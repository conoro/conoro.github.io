#"Get Paid Apps on your Android Phone in Ireland"


 One thing that has me incensed about Google is how the country that enables them to avoid tax on billions of dollars in revenue is generally paddy-last (pun intended) when it comes to app support.<p />It was only in late 2008 that Google Maps finally showed more than one road in West Cork. Their most recent manifestation of this attitude is the <a href="http://market.android.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=150324">lack of paid apps</a> for Irish users of Android phones. Whilst this was acceptable when only me and 5 others had unlocked US G1s, we have had mobile networks selling Android phones here for 3 months now. Grrrrrrr.<p /> Go into the Android Store on a G1 with a Vodafone or O2 Irish SIM and all you see are free apps.<p />Now take that SIM out and pop in a Three UK PAYG SIM which you paid 10 for the last time you were in the UK and taa-daa, paid apps.<p /> And this is sitting in rainy West Cork with no Three signal so I&#39;m roaming on the Vodafone Ireland network!<p />As a test I just bought Pixelpipe Pro for $0.99. And for double kicks I tested the use of the <a href="http://www.entropay.com/">Entropay Virtual Visa</a> to pay for it and used an Irish address and phone in Checkout. <p /> <b>And it worked!<br /></b><br />FFS Google, if all the bits are in place and working, including Google Checkout, what is the bloody problem?
