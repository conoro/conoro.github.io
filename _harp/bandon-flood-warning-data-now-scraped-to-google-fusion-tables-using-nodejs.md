After 3 years running as a Python script on a file server, the Bandon FEWS scraper is now running on an ODROID-C1 under Node.js and soon on OpenShift.

## Introduction
Cork County Council in Ireland has a site called [Bandon FEWS](http://www.bandonfloodwarning.ie/) (Bandon Flood Early Warning System). When the Bandon river hits certain levels near Bandon town, it alerts registered users via SMS in case they need to take emergency measures. It's a very useful service and is very necessary due to the regular flooding that occurs. However the historical river level data is not available in any useful form and that's the point of this project.

In November 2011, I created [a simple Python script](http://conoroneill.com/2011/11/17/bandon-flood-fews-open-data-now-available/) which scrapes the site every 15 minutes and saves the river level to a Google Fusions Table "spreadsheet" [here](https://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?docid=103YIcARoxuaWT7NfZ8mVBzY554sF_3ONYC1N3DE#rows:id=1). This now has (with a few interruptions) 3 years of data which anyone can query, re-use or slice-dice and mashup with weather info. Not that anyone has done this :-)

The script has been running on a small home Ubuntu fileserver all this time but stopped working mid-December 2014 either due to changes with the page structure of the Council site or as unexpected fallout from upgrading to Ubuntu 14.04. I have therefore re-written it in Node.js which has the big added advantage that there are free hosting possibilities for this code such as my employer Red Hat's [OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/).

Code is now available on [GitHub here](https://github.com/conoro/bandonfews-nodejs).

The code started as Google's example G+ OAuth code but now has the bulk of the functionality completed. It is running reliably under Supervisor on an [ODROID-C1](http://www.hardkernel.com/main/products/prdt_info.php?g_code=G141578608433) single-board computer on my desk.

To use it for something else on Fusion Tables, the main thing you need to do is setup an App in the [Google API Console](https://console.developers.google.com/project?authuser=0), enable Fusion Tables API access and use those keys in the placeholders in the config files.

## Files
* main.js - The main code
* bandonfews.conf - Supervisor config file. Copy to /etc/supervisor/conf.d/bandonfews.conf then `sudo supervisorctl reread` and `sudo supervisorctl reread`
* tokens-example.json - rename to tokens.json. Will be auto-generated by the code on first run in any case
* config-example.json - Rename to config.json and fill out the Google OAuth API key/secret, the URL of the FEWS site and the id of the Fusion Table
* index.html - Placeholder for upcoming landing page
* server.js - Placeholder for upcoming API server
* package.json - Required Node.js packages. `npm install` to install everything
* .gitignore - Stuff that shouldn't go under Git control


## OpenShift Environment Variables
If you are running on OpenShift, you need a way to set various keys etc without adding them to files in Git which could potentially leak accidentally if you also put a copy up on GitHub. So set the following (mirroring the equivalent ones in config.json and tokens.json):

```rhc set-env access_token="blah" token_type="Bearer" refresh_token="blah" expiry_date=1419970265050 client_id="blah" client_secret="blah" redirect_url="http://localhost" fews_url="http://www.bandonfloodwarning.ie/main.php" fusiontables_id="blah" -a bandonfews ```


## TO-DO
* The first time run is currently broken for the OAuth credentials. Easy fix coming.
* OpenShift is SIGINT'ing it for some unknown reason after a random time which is why it's running on the ODROID for the moment
* It should have a simple Express based API so others can avoid the pain of dealing with the Fusion Tables API for basic queries
* It should have a simple landing page showing the latest water level and maybe a graph
* It should add back in the functionality of the old Python code for posting to COSM
* ???

## Release Notes
* 04/01/2015 - First public usable version
