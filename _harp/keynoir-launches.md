 <p>I'm delighted for Phil Wilkinson and the rest of the team involved in the launch of Keynoir.
</p><p>One benefit of the recession is the number of sites being created around special offers. We already work with <a href="http://luckebox.com">Luckebox</a> in this area in <a href="http://www.loudervoice.com">LouderVoice</a> and I know of several others in the planning and Alpha stages.
</p><p>Keynoir looks like a winner to me and has the team to deliver on it.</p></div>
