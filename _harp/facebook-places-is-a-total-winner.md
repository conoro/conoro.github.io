<p>I&#39;ve been saying it for months, but Social Check-in will be owned by Facebook and Google. Startups that didn&#39;t take M&amp;A offers from them are completely deluded. This is not a &quot;we could be the next Twitter&quot; scenario. Now that I&#39;ve seen Facebook Places in action, I believe that even more</p><p /><div>I finally managed to get Places working by saying I was in Palo Alto and connecting to <a href="http://touch.facebook.com">http://touch.facebook.com</a> on my Android phone over a U.S. VPN (or maybe someone in Facebook was just very nice to me :-) ). I created the LouderVoice &quot;spot&quot; and then checked in. It used the location feature of HTML5 in the browser to figure out where I was. Trivial to do and fully integrated into my normal day to day Facebook usage.</div> <p /><div>No more &quot;close Facebook, open Foursquare, check-in, close Foursquare, open Facebook&quot;.</div><p /><div>Just Facebook.</div><p /><div>Our Places page looks like the attached picture. and the only glitch I&#39;ve noticed is that the &quot;Is this your business&quot; feature (see <a href="http://www.allfacebook.com/facebook-places-business-2010-08">AllFacebook.com</a> for more details) is not there. I wonder is this because we are outside of the U.S. and they don&#39;t actually have address/contact info for us, just GPS co-ordinates?</div> <p /><div>More updates as I explore.</div>
