#"Dear Sky, don't threaten me"


 <p>We disconnected the phone lines from our Sky boxes over a year ago. That plus removing all extension wiring got us another 1Mbs on our shitty Eircom "7 Mbs" ADSL line. We have both a Sky HD and the old Sky+ for the kids in "multi-room" setup. Sky just mailed us to bitch that they can't confirm where those boxes are and that we might be doing something naughty like using them in Ulan Bator to watch I'm A Celebrity. They are threatening to charge us full whack for the two boxes if we don't re-connect.</p>
<p />
<div>Couple of things, Sky:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>The assumption of illegal behaviour by your customers is just one of the reasons your brand is hated</li>
<li>Try charging us more and we'll cancel immediately and switch to an FTA box from Lidl.&nbsp;</li>
<li>There is a LAN connection on the back of the Sky HD. This is 2011. Why can't I use that and you can GeoIP your heart out?</li>
<li>I don't want any of your 2 year-old movies, or "gag", sport.</li>
</ul>
