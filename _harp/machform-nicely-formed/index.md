#"Machform nicely formed"


 <p>When the new biz site launched we used the Contact Form 7 plugin for Wordpress. Whilst it does a good job for basic forms, we soon ran into its limitations. I had seen good success in the past with <a href="http://www.appnitro.com/">Machform</a> on the BarCamp Cork site so gave that a trial instead.<p /> It's working really well for us. Install is trivial and creating forms is all drag n drop. It's very inexpensive at &euro;29 and the forms can be pasted into most sites with almost no effort.<p />The only two drawbacks are that styling is done by editing CSS instead of a control panel and it cannot do conditional fields (e.g. if person ticks "yes" in question N, show them something new).<p /> </p>
