#"Replacing a broken Samsung Google Nexus S screen - a total doddle."

My Dad put a big crack is his Nexus S screen a good while back so I promptly ordered a replacement <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/Replacement-LCD-Touch-Screen-Display-Assembly-For-Samsung-Google-Nexus-S-i9023-/290768756299?">from eBay</a>. I finally got the chance to fit it this morning and was thrilled that I didn't manage to completely screw it up.

A few useful notes:
<ol>
	<li><span style="line-height: 15px;">There are two major types of Nexus S. His is an i9023</span></li>
	<li>Apparently there are also two different types of i9023 screen which are not interchangeable. Luckily the one I ordered just worked.</li>
	<li>It's really easy to take the phone apart
<ol>
	<li>Pop the back off</li>
	<li>Remove a few screws</li>
	<li>Remove the inside back, popping off the snap-connectors as you go</li>
	<li>Be careful popping out the buzzer</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>You remove the screen+digitizer module by applying lots of heat with a hairdryer. Use a plastic knife or plastic phone tool to apply leverage from the side and work your way around. Eventually it'll separate.</li>

The only bit that had me worried was the adhesive. It was pretty much ruined by taking the screen off. I went to the local DIY store an bought a selection of double sided tapes and contact adhesives.

I the end I used some ALDI thin-ish double-sized foam tape to connect the top and bottom parts where the earpiece and buttons are. I then used simple Unibond no-thickness double-sided tape to cover the back of the screen. Together they joined the screen to the main body of the phone perfectly.

Then it was just a quick reverse process of clicking back on the connectors and putting screws in. It worked perfectly first time. And I had no parts left over!
