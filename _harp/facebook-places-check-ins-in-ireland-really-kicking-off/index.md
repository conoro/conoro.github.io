#"Facebook Places Check-ins in Ireland really kicking off"


 Over the past few months, I&#39;ve watched Facebook Places functionality get closer and closer to properly live for those of us in Ireland.<p /><div>We geeks initially used VPNs on our phones to spoof that we were in the US so we could check-in in Ireland. Then I spotted the FB Ireland people checking in here.</div> <p /><div>More recently the Android App stopped giving an error and showed check-ins here.</div><p /><div>Now today it&#39;s like everyone found it at the same time! My Facebook feed has tons of Irish check-ins.</div> <p /><div>So how quickly before everyone starts bitching about it like they did with FarmVille updates?</div><p /><div>Of course I won&#39;t be happy until they turn on Facebook Deals in Starbucks at Cork Airport.</div> <p /><div><div>The question is now whether I&#39;ll bother my arse doing my usual 4SQ+Gowalla check-ins? Without special offers local to me, they just can&#39;t compete with FB.</div></div>
