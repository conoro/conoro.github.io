#"Open Data Ireland's first meetup tonight in Engine Yard"

Great to see this <a href="http://meetup.opendata.ie/">Meetup</a> happen and big props to Eamon and the crew for hosting.If you are interested in getting involved in OpenData in Ireland please attend. <a href="http://meetup.opendata.ie/">Registration is here</a> but the event is free.

Ireland needs to get beyond talking about OpenData and start increasing the number of people actually <em><strong>Opening Up The Data</strong></em> in a big way. The Irish tech community has to lead by example and that means just doing it.

There is so much data out there that anyone with even a modicum of technical ability could unleash. The most complicated thing I had to do in geo-coding the Property Price Register was to merge two columns in Excel!

I'm hopefully (the Eircom DSL gods permitting) going to give a short talk remotely from Bandon, long known as "The Silicon Valley on the N71" :-) I've a few bits n bobs to describe, some thoughts to share and some ideas I hope others can run with.

Ideally we'll do the whole thing as a Google+ Live Hangout so anyone can connect in. <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/1/events/cucdbuf9rfs1c5qu6ldapj1f1f4">Sign up for the Hangout here</a>. I'll post the Live URL if we have success with it. If that falls apart then I'm afraid it'll just be point-to-point Skype.
