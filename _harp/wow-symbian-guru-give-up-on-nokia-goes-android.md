 <p>It's one thing for a nobody like me to walk away from a decade of Nokia ownership. But when the guy who wrote _the_ must-read Symbian blog gives up, then Nokia have a massive problem on their hands.
</p><p>Every day I use my HTC Desire I find new neat features I wasn't aware of. I just can't see Nokia having the will to leapfrog past everyone to create the ultimate mobile experience. Too much baggage.
</p><p>Having said that, they did it before when they used to make loo-roll, so I hope I'm wrong.</p></div>
