<p>Earlier in the week I got annoyed at Facebook for changing yet another API for no good reason (oh let&#39;s change blah_blah to blahBlah from now on, just for kicks). I&#39;ve come to the realisation that they are breaking the web bit by bit. A site you built in 1997 willprobablybe 100% functional in 2011. A site you built in 2010 with deep Facebook integration, will probably be 90% broken in 2012 if you are notmaintainingit daily. </p><p /><div>But this, this takes the fucking biscuit. Any site or service that uses their Python SDK including the millions of Django sites out there are now up shit creek as they just deleted it off Github!</div> <p /><div>Does anyone in Facebook understand version control? Did you not think to allow people to fork it first?</div><p /><div>And why the hell would you need to save a couple of hundred kb of storage on GitHub? Just put a message in the goddammed README saying &quot;no longer supported&quot;.</div> <p /><div>Facebook, you need togrowthe fuck up, <i><b>fast</b></i>. I have a 5 year old daughter who has more maturity and understands the impact of her decisions better than you.</div><p /><div>The message from that developer says everything about what&#39;s broken in the Facebook organisation and mindset. Just because FB has a global team of developers working 24x7 on Facebook doesn&#39;t mean the rest of us do. If all we do is spend our days trying to fix things you break or change, we&#39;re not focused on our own businesses. So we can &quot;simply&quot; switch to urllib.urlopen can we? Will you pay a developer to do that for me?</div> <p /><div>I&#39;m ok as I should have a GitHub clone of the repo somewhere I can use. Thank you Linus for creating a distributed version control system which prevents retarded behaviour like this from totally shafting people.</div>
