#"Could Skype build a Twitter competitor?"


 Random brain-fart time. I jokingly suggested earlier that Twitter was just a front-end on the Skype IM system which is why both of them are down. <p /><div>Now I&#39;m sitting here thinking &quot;well ye know..........&quot;</div><p /><div>Skype has the infrastructure, the contact lists and the userbase.</div><p /><div>Could they build both a single-threaded global system like Twitter with asymmetrical relationships and also a variation on their Groups feature, again where people can join rather than being invited?</div> <p /><div>I always remember that stupid but brilliantly compact line by Thesaurus Gillmor that Twitter was the new dialtone. Shouldn&#39;t that really be Skype&#39;s job?</div>
