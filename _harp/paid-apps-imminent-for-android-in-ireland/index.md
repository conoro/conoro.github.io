#"Paid Apps Imminent for Android in Ireland?"


 <p>Oooh, I just noticed a change in the Android Marketplace. With my Vodafone Ireland SIM, I can now upgrade paid apps that I bought on my 3 UK SIM.</p>
<p>I also spotted a tweet earlier that Google Checkout now works here too.</p>
<p>Still can't buy apps but I'm guessing we are very close.</p>
<p>Wahoo!</p>
