We had to empty our attic to get the house insulated this week. I uncovered some old Red Hat and Fedora floppies and CDs. I previously had much older ones but was quite ruthless about reusing floppies in the old days!

The very first Linux I installed was Slackware on a self-built AMD K5 PC in Sunnyvale in 1996 (I've never built a PC with Intel CPUs! Current box is self-built FX-8 Eight Core 8370). I was so traumatised by the Slackware experience, as a Windows 95 user, that I didn't try again until '97 with Red Hat Linux 4. My oldest floppy is from Red Hat 6.2 in 2000:

I then found a guy in the UK who would burn each new release of Red Hat onto CDs and send them to you for a few quid. That kept me going for ages. Here's a Red Hat 7.0 boot floppy cunningly reusing a Windows NT disk:

Then Red Hat 7.3 updates on CD

And finally Fedora Core 1 boot disk:

Next week I finally rid myself of the last vestiges of Ubuntu and move the home-office file server to CentOS 7 :-) I'm baaaaaaaack.
