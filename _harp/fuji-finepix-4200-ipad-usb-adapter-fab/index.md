#"Fuji Finepix 4200 + iPad + USB Adapter = Fab"

Barely scratched the surface of it but it's like being in a different century to our old point n shoots.

One obvious drawback of a non-cameraphone is that you lose Instant Upload to the web. It's a bit of a kerfuffle to remove the SD Card, power up a laptop and then upload.

Recently I got a dirt cheap USB adapter for the iPad on Deal Extreme in Hong Kong. I loved that you could stick a USB stick or similar into it to copy stuff into the iPad.

Today I had a brainwave. I took the camera's USB cable, plugged it into the iPad USB adapter and taa-daaaa, the iPad offered to import all the pictures on the camera.

That's a really really slick setup. Once I find out what the best photo editor is for iPad, I have the perfect mobile photo taking/editing/upload/blogging setup.

The only practical improvement I'll be making in the coming months is to get a sub-$100 7" Android tablet to do the same. Without needing an adapter of course.
