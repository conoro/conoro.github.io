#"Unlock that old broadband modem from the contract you cancelled"


 Recently I cancelled my contract for O2 mobile broadband. I was dishing out 30 per month for a service I maybe using a few days a month. I found that the N95-8GB or HTC G1 as a tethered modem with a 1GB data add-on for my Vodafone phone SIM was more than sufficient for my current needs. <p /><div>However, it seemed an awful shame to leave the Huawei E270 modem unused since it is bloody good and does 7.2Mbs unlike a lot of the &quot;stick&quot; modems.</div><p /><div>Unfortunately it is SIM locked to O2.</div> <p /><div>Fortunately<a href="http://www.dc-unlocker.com">DC-unlocker</a> exists. I downloaded their simple free app which identified the modem and said it was locked. Then for a quick payment of 10 via PayPal, it unlocked it for me. All done in about 5 minutes.</div> <p /><div>The Vodafone SIM works beautifully in it now, even with the O2 software on the laptop! Just setup a new APN for <a href="http://hs.vodafone.ie">hs.vodafone.ie</a>. I&#39;ll test the Three UK SIM when I am in range of a decent 3G data signal.</div> <p /><div>Now the next time Eircom DSL goes down, I still have a backup plan:</div><div><ul><li>Re-direct mobile to landline or Three UK mobile</li><li>Put Vodafone SIM in O2 dongle connected to external antenna</li> <li>Connect dongle to the 3G port of the <a href="http://www.broadbandbuyer.co.uk/Shop/ShopDetail.asp?ProductID=7237">Billion Router</a></li><li>Data for the entire house!</li></ul></div><div>Another recession-busting tip from West Cork!</div>
