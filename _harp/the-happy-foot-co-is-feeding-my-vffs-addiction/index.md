#"The Happy Foot Co is feeding my #VFFs Addiction"


 <p>It's ridiculous I know. I average one pair of new footwear every two years. I wear shoes until they fall apart and then I buy one more pair. That's now utterly changed.</p>
<p>I bought my Vibram Five Fingers Bikilas exactly one month ago. Running on a treadmill with them is genuinely like having new legs. Unfortunately, like a fool, I ran on the road only two weeks in and I'm still suffering with a pain in one foot. But I'm a convert and an evangelist already.</p>
<p>The one downside - they stink and washing only helps for a day or two. I wanted to wear them all the time.</p>
<p>Tuesday I was in Dublin and after a really interesting mobile tech workshop, I wandered down to <a href="http://happyfootco.ie/">The Happy Foot Co</a> on Liffey Street, off Henry Street. I remembered that the last shop I went into on Liffey St was Hector Gray's when I was a kid.</p>
<p>The Happy Foot Co shop is amazing. Loads of different types of VFFs and a bajillion pairs of Crocs. I'll be bringing the kids back soon to get their summer Crocs.</p>
<p>The two ladies running the place could not have been more helpful. They even offered to post down any pair that they didn't have in stock. I wanted a pair for general day to day use that wouldn't look too freakish. I tried on a few types including one of their new ones made of kangaroo skin. Sooooo soft.</p>
<p>In the end, I went with the <a href="http://www.vibramfivefingers.com/products/Five-Fingers-KSO-Mens.htm">KSO</a>, the most popular men's model. They are incredibly comfortable and equally good in a meeting or on a mountain (allegedly). They go beautifully with Black Tie, Pinstripe, Jeans, Shorts, Speedos or Thongs. I intend to try them in all those scenarios.</p>

<p>I've been doing a bit of reading on VFFs and it looks like I'm doing the same thing as all n00bies; I'm running almost on the balls of my feet because of everything we've been told about heel-strikes being bad. One blogger likened it to looking like a bizarre ballerina. Of course I've been told many times of my striking resemblance to the Black Swan, ignoring my bigger boobs and my opposite eating disorder.</p>

<p>Two pairs of shoes in a month and I'm already thinking about a pair of Classics instead of flip-flops for my summer holidays. Next thing I'll be watching Project Runway.</p>
