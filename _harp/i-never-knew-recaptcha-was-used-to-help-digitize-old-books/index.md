#"I never knew reCAPTCHA was used to help digitize old books"

Yesterday on Twitter I jokingly suggested that Facebook's CAPTCHA had a "sure that's close enough" setting since there was no way I'd guessed the second word correctly. Then two people pointed out that the second word was optional. I was gobsmacked. Years of hitting refresh until I got a word I could read, followed by the stress of guesssing, wasted!

This morning <a href="http://twitter.com/jkeyes">John Keyes</a> put us straight. Any site using <a href="http://www.google.com/recaptcha">reCAPTCHA</a> is actually helping to <a href="http://www.google.com/recaptcha/learnmore">digitize old books</a>. The first word in each pair is known but the second is from a scan of an old book where they don't know the word. If you guess first word correctly then there is a good chance you guessed the second one too. So they now have that second word scanned. I assume each word is given to multiple people to get a consensus.

What a simple but brilliant idea. From now on I'm gonna do my best on that second word but without the stress.
