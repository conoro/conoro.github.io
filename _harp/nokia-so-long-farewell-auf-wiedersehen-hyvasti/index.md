#"Nokia - So long, farewell, auf Wiedersehen, Hyv\u00e4sti"


 <p>I was a mobile phone late adopter for a very long time.After a couple of crappy feature phones from the likes of Panasonic in the 1990s, I got my first decent Nokia in 2000, the legendary 6210.</p>

<p>I hung on to that for ages and then finally upgraded to the equally beloved 6230i in 2004.</p>

<p>I only joined the ranks of smartphone owners in 2006 when I got the N70. Not Nokia's greatest phone but good enough to make me want more.</p>

<p>Then finally in 2007, I got Nokia's (still) best ever phone, the N95-8GB.</p>

</p>
<p>On Friday, I powered down the N95-8GB and probably won't power it back up again unless I need its camera for some Qik streaming.On Friday I also powered up my new HTC Desire.</p>

<p>Nothing that Nokia sells now or has announced for the rest of 2010/2011 holds any interest for me. And the shafting of N95 owners over the free Ovi Maps says that Nokia has no interest in me as a customer either.I think they are a bit like the Catholic church who have realised there is more money/souls to be had in the developing world than trying to compete for attention at the high end in the developed world.</p>
<p>End of an era for me.</p>
