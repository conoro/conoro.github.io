#"Ubuntu for Android - All the Horror of Unity in your pocket"

<blockquote>Why carry two devices, when you could carry only one? Your next high-end smartphone has far more horsepower than youll need on a phone, and more than enough for a laptop. So weve brought Android together with Ubuntu, the worlds favourite free operating system, to give you a full productivity desktop that fits in your pocket. Android for the phone experience, Ubuntu for the desktop, all on one device, running at the same time.</blockquote>

Shudder shudder shudder. Ubuntu, please stop releasing new products and hire some people who know the first thing about OS GUIs. Unity is the first GUI on <em>any</em> platform (desktop, mobile, game) where my kids couldn't find their apps.

Hands up who uses the Libreoffice Powerpoint clone on Ubuntu more than the Terminal. I rest my case.
