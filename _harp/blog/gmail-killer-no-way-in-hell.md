    <div style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: lucida grande, tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-family: lucida grande, tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Every time in the past two years that Facebook launches something, they have knocked my socks off. I just don&#39;t know how they execute that quickly with such a small team and such a gigantic user-base. Seeing Google struggle to keep up is frightening.</span></div> <p />But lets be realistic about theannouncementtoday that many people are saying will be a GMail killer. If Facebook launches an email app that is functionally superior to GMail today, I&#39;ll watch the Late Late Show and a football match this week. Yes, I&#39;m willing to risk my mental health like that for the sake of a bet.<p /> But then, we&#39;d need to see IMAP, Custom Domains, Multiple Accounts, Filters, Sigs, POP3 from 3rd party accounts, Labels, Priority Inbox, Labs, perfect anti-spam etc etc etc.<p /><div><span style="font-family: lucida grande, tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Hotmail killer sure, AOL mail killer absolutely, Yahoo Mail killer maybe.</span><p /><div><span style="font-family: lucida grande, tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: lucida grande, tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">But GMail? C&#39;mon, unless Bucheit was reaalllllllly busy over the past few months :-)</span></span></span></div> <p /><div><span style="font-family: lucida grande, tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">I know lots of normal punters who rarely check their Hotmail etc now, they rely entirely on Facebook. But the current app is terrible.</span><span style="font-family: lucida grande, tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">If they launch an upgraded email app today, then it only needs to be average to grab even more market share from the usual suspects.</span></div> <div><span style="font-family: lucida grande, tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"></span></div></div><div>An interesting aside, my Dad asked me yesterday to finally put a bullet in his <a href="http://eircom.net">eircom.net</a> account and switch everything over to GMail. Android+GMail is the killer app for him.</div>
