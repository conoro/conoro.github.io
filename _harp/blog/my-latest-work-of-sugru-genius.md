#"My Latest Work of Sugru Genius"


 I&#39;m a big fan of Lidl keyboards and mice. They are now just as reliable as anything Microsoft or Logitech does and much cheaper. However whilst their wireless receivers have been getting smaller and smaller over the years they have also been getting more and more fragile. One of them shattered completely on me recently so of course I reached for the Sugru. <p /><div>In my enthusiasm to create something with a bit of character, I forgot that it was supposed to sit inside the mouse when travelling. Ah well, I&#39;ll take a smile over usefulness any day.</div><p /> <p><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>
