#"Oscar's First Android Game via App Inventor"


 <p>I have to say I'd dead proud of young Oscar. Seven hours ago he'd never seen a line of code. Now he has finished his first from-scratch game. He calls it "The Reaction Game" and it involves tapping buttons as fast as possible in 60 seconds.</p>

<p>We've had some choice quotes from him today:</p>
<ul>
<li>I want to build a game like all those stupid ones people play on Facebook</li>
<li>It's still Beta. We'll add high scores and difficulty levels next week.</li>
<li>I think this could be the next Angry Birds</li>
<li>Wait a second, this means I could build a Chuck Norris Soundboard!</li>
<li>Why won't it work on an iPhone?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to try it out, <a href="http://cdn.conoroneill.com/TheReactionGameV2.apk">download the APK</a> and install on your Android phone.</p>
<p>Few quick thoughts.</p>
<ul>
<li>Google has built a great tool&nbsp;</li>
<li>It needs more kid-attractive tutorials</li>
<li>As I said in last post, web services need to be wired in to allow cool audio, video and image applications. Maybe even Twitter/Facebook APIs.</li>
<li>Kids love games, work that to the max for tutorials</li>
<li>But Google completely lacks coolness and mindshare. He wants to tap into Facebook. Not sure how Google fixes that.</li>
</ul>
<p>So a kid who was building a Google Android App has this as the back of his laptop. Why? Cos Facebook is cool. (Yeah and I gave him the stickers). Do you see a Goog logo or Android logo anywhere?</p>

<p>I really only had to give him a few pointers on using timers and conditional logic. He figured the rest out himself.</p>
<p>11 years old and he's already thinking monetization :-)</p>
