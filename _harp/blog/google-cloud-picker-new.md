<p>I just tried inserting an image in a Google Doc and got this new dialog. Interesting!</p>
<p />
<div>Of course it didn't bloody work. When I tried to Sign-in, it said "<span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">The feature you requested is currently unavailable. Please try again later.</span>". I assume due to the usual Google Apps Accounts vs Normal Google Accounts messing that seems to have got worse rather than better since they "upgraded" the abilities of Goog Apps Accounts.</div>
