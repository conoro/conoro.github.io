#"Anyone want paddysvalley.org and .com?"

I've been renewing those two domains since 2007 despite the fact that I never actually went on the trip.

They come up for renewal on April 19th for $20 for the pair with GoDaddy. Nameservers and hosting are with Blacknight.

I won't be renewing.

If you want them for free, let me know. I dunno how to transfer domains but I'm sure it's not that hard.
