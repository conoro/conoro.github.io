#"Another big brain dump of interesting tech bits over the past few weeks"

<ul>
	<li><span style="line-height: 15px;">Thrilled to find that Bluetooth on <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2348272">this Play Edition ROM</a> for SGS4 works perfectly. I've gone from 20% success rate auto-connecting to my Lidl car stereo to 100%, Finally!</span></li>
	<li><a href="http://nodeconf.eu/">Nodeconf Europe</a> is on in Waterford Mon-Wed. Incredible line-up of speakers. Superb IoT sessions set for Monday. A conference driven by expertise, not bullshit-artists hyping vapourware.</li>
	<li>Ordered an <a href="http://www.espruino.com/">Espruino</a> - run JS on an MCU</li>
	<li>This --------&gt; &lt;-------- close to ordering a <a href="http://technical.io/">Tessel</a> - moar JS on an MCU, this time with NPM support</li>
	<li>Waiting to order an <a href="http://blog.arduino.cc/2013/09/05/hands-on-the-arduino-yuns-bridge/">Arduino Yun</a>= Arduino + Wifi machine + bridge libraries</li>
	<li>Of course I had to back this <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/556341540/pressy-the-almighty-android-button">Pressy button</a> for my Android phone. One of those slap-head projects that you can't believe you never thought of yourself.</li>
	<li>What has happened to <a href="http://ql.io">ql.io</a>? Was a very cool open source Node.js project from eBay for querying a variety of web-services using a SQL like language. Doing joins across data from multiple sites was damned impressive. Have they shut it down?</li>
	<li>Finally got <a href="https://twitter.com/conoro/status/374180519564836864">Arduino talking to Raspberry Pi</a> using two nRF24L01+ 2.4GHz devices. The libraries work great but it was the error-riddled blogposts by the author that made it take so long. I'll write up my own with the correct info soon. However it is not "<a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewGraley/status/374229759150264320">Intrinsically Safe</a>".</li>
	<li>More MBP stupidity - horrible monochrome mini icons; favicons on Safari?; How do I discover that Safari is how to access the internet?; Caps Lock key in 2013 why?; but tiny arrow keys; no UK layout keymap for external keyboards; try to remember print-screen three-finger-salute; Magic Mouse hurts; DMG files - oh my god; Finder, oh hello 1989.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-Keyboard-Dock-Package/dp/B0040HEMP8">Apple keyboard dock for iPad</a> is one of the worst pieces of industrial design of all time. Hilariously unstable and unusable. Going to hack a USB cable for it to see if it'll work as a PC keyboard since the buttons are nice.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Logitech-Ultrathin-Keyboard-Cover-iPad/dp/B00835UQK8/">Logitech Ultra-thin keyboard case</a> for iPad is one of the best pieces of industrial design I've used. My Dad liking it a lot too. He may say bye bye to his heavy laptop.</li>
	<li><a href="http://fromscratched.nl/index.php/shrimpkey-maak-je-eigen-makeymakey-deel-1/?lang=en">ShrimpKey</a> - Take the Shrimp DIY Arduino and turn it into a DIY Makey Makey. Neat.</li>
	<li>Two different HDMI to VGA adapters cause horrendous pulsating noise on the analogue audio output of all my Raspberry Pis. Anyone else seeing/hearing this?</li>
	<li>Only getting a 65Mbs connection from SGS4 phone to a Wireless-N AP when I'm right beside it. I have channel set not to overlap with any others. Where the hell is this mythical 300Mbs then?</li>
	<li>My <a href="http://conoroneill.net/a-simple-tool-to-bulk-import-your-runkeeper-data-into-endomondo/">Runkeeper to Endomondo import tool</a> now supports Sports Tracker too</li>
	<li><a href="http://jasonmadigan.com/2013/07/04/high-altitude-adventures-part-3/">Very very neat helium balloon project</a> by Jason Madigan</li>
	<li>XBMC now supports <a href="http://xbmc.org/xbmc-13-gotham-august-cycle/">hardware video decoding on Android</a>. Unfortunately not on Allwinner or AMLogic chips which is a total bummer as a large percentage of cheap devices use them. Fault lies totally with Allwinner and AMLogic. The <a href="http://www.xbmcandroid.com/2013/05/04/finally-a-stable-release-of-our-end-user-friendly-xaf-custom-build-of-xbmc-for-android-is-out/">unofficial XBMC for Android</a> works like a charm on my SGS4.</li>
	<li>No software application is complete until you can write code inside it. <a href="https://plus.google.com/100132233764003563318/posts/JMM8j4sPbsk">Code editor with Git support inside Chrome</a>.</li>
	<li>I'm sure I've forgotten 10 other things.</li>
