#"So long Google Health. Hello Microsoft HealthVault."


    I got the dire email from Google earlier in the week reminding me to download all of my Google Health data before the end of the year. I did so today whilst feeling terribly depressed about the missed opportunity. It&#39;s one of the first times I&#39;ve ever fully deleted any online account for anything.<p /><div>But it was interesting to see Google offer export to<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/healthvault/">Microsoft HealthVault</a> as an option. A few clicks later and all my data moved datacentres somewhere.</div> <p /><div>Hopefully MSFT will play the long game with HealthVault. Have they any plans for Windows Phone 7 Apps to integrate in HealthVault? If WP7 is to have a chance of competing, it needsdifferentiation. Building something that kicks RunKeeper&#39;s ass and has a strong health angle could be one way to do that. (Yet another area where Nokia was ahead of everyone and pissed it all away).</div> <p /><div><br /><div> </div></div>
