#"Google Buzz Team. Stop. Now."


    Google Buzz just gave me screen after screen of tweets spread over a few hours from people I follow, <i>all in one go</i>. <p /><div>Buzz is broken. Pretty much every user-impacting decision they made was wrong. Google built an application where Employee of the Month went to whoever could rattle off the largest number of Open Standards inthirtyseconds. Open blahblahblah blah blah blah, Activity blah blah, rel=yawn, federated blah blah blah, semantic circlejerk 3.0.</div> <p /><div>We users don&#39;t care. We want something we can bloody use.</div><div><ul><li><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><b>Stop.</b><b>Now</b>.</span></li> <li><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Shut everything down except built-in updates and comments.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Shut down all the &quot;algorithms&quot;</span></li> <li><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Shut down the hooks to Reader</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Shut down auto-everything</span></li> <li><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Shut down auto-scrolling</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Comments from people I do not follow are not important.</span></li> <li><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Recreate Jaiku with Google Contacts</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Launch that</span></li> <li><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Iterate</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Ye know, basically that thing you should have done when you bought Jaiku in the first place.</span></li> </ul><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><br />Stop talking about open-standards that no-one gives a good-god-damn about and start talking about <b>users</b> and their <b>needs</b>.<p /> Hire some designers who know the first thing about User Experience and privacy concerns.

Wheel, Google.</span></div><p /><div><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">I think that&#39;s me and Buzz on a trial separation until they get the basics right.</span></div>
