#"The FrankenLego RC car is progressing nicely"

The idea behind this was to highlight how Lego could do something really powerful for a much wider range of kids than the insanely priced Mindstorms.

I started with this really impressive <a href="http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=8048-1">Lego Technic Dune Buggy</a>that some of my kids assembled ages ago.

I then butchered it and added a geared motor, a motor shield, an Arduino Uno, a LiPo battery, an nRF24L01 transceiverand a servo to create FrankenLego:

The basics work ok. Finishing the steering is next along with an improved connection of the wheels to the motor.

All for a fraction of what Mindstorms costs. Yes I know you can get motors for Technic but they are missing a big middle ground here by insisting on sticking with the over-thought over-designed over-priced under-achieving Mindstorms.
