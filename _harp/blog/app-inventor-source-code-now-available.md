#"App Inventor Source Code Now Available"

<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/app-inventor-announcements/jTfW1d2OMxo">Thrilled to see</a> that the<a href="http://code.google.com/p/app-inventor-releases/">code is now available</a> for anyone to grab and modify. Once MIT is up and running well, they'll start accepting contributions.

My challenge to all the developers out there - port all of AppInventor to iOS. This would be far far more important and valuable for a child's education than some overpriced e-Books on a single vendor platform.
