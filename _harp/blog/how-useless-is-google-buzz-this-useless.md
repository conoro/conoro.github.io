    <p>In the latest of my tough love posts about Buzz (tagline "We're moany bitches cos we care"), I take a screencast of what was displayed to me when I checked Buzz this morning:</p>

<p>6 weeks later and they still think this is acceptable.</p>
<p>TURN OFF THE GODDAMMED EXTERNAL FEEDS IN BUZZ NOW.</p>
<p>Thanks sweeties.</p>
<p>In other Buzz news, I discovered last night that someone with a clue in Google turned on the ability for those with non-2.x versions of Android to access it. It remains the best way to use Buzz by far. The reality is Buzz should have been launched as a mobile-only product. If all the focus had gone there, Foursquare and Gowalla would be crapping themselves instead of laughing themselves to sleep every night.</p>
<p>Or if they'd had some joined-up thinking, it would have been the address book in Android from day 1. Ye know, what we all thought they bought Jaiku for.</p>
<p>Apologies to @interactivemark for using his Friendfeed stream import in Buzz to highlight the problem.</p>
