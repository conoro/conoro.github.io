#"Google ChromeOS Flow is a speedy wee thing"


    <p>Yep, still Alpha, still very rough, but any OS that boots in a few seconds (faster than my phone in fact) and has me online a few seconds later has something going for it</p>
<p>Looking forward to seeing it tweaked for a tablet. HTML5 annnnnd Flash.</p>

<p>To try it out, all you need is a 2GB thumbdrive and pretty much any standard netbook. Grab the file from <a href="http://chromeos.hexxeh.net/">Hexxeh</a>, follow his simple instructions and you'll have ChromeOS booted within minutes of the download and it won't touch whatever is installed on the machine.</p>
