<p><div style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; border-collapse: collapse;"><div>I&#39;m &quot;following&quot; 202 people on Buzz. Of course following would mean that I logon more than once a week.</div> <p /><div>Look closely at that screenshot. One person, one, is actually posting on Buzz. Every single other post there is automatically pulled from Twitter, Friendfeed, Flickr etc etc. No matter how far back I scroll, it&#39;s the same.</div> <p /><div>Kill it. Start again. Hire some people who actually understand people, not code.</div><p /><div>As for Latitude. C&#39;mon, are there even 4 people on the planet using it?</div><p /> </div></p>
