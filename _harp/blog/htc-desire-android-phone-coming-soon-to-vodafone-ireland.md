<p>From recent Tweet by @VodafoneIreland to actual announcement in under two weeks. Nice job VF, for real.</p>
<p>Think of it as a Nexus One with snazzy user interface and optical "trackball".</p>
<p>Or think of it as an iPhone where you are in control, not someone in Cupertino.</p>
<p>All things being equal, this will be my next phone. The only things that might prevent that are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vodafone being stupid and charging a fortune for it on upgrade. *cough* N900 *cough*</li>
<li>Vodafone being stupid and locking it to O2-style iPhone price plans</li>
<li>Google congratulating LouderVoice for launching the first ever Irish Android application and giving me a Nexus One for free</li>
<li>Vodafone congratulating LouderVoice for launching the first ever Irish Android application and giving me a HTC Desire for free</li>
<li>Sony Ericsson magically fixing multi-touch on the X10 and it being available at the same time for the same price with Android 2.1. I really would like an 8MP camera.</li>
<li>Nokia somehow pulling a rabbit out of a hat in the next couple of weeks and announcing a N900++ with 12MP camera and capacitive touch screen, for the same price.</li>
<li>Someone else announces yet another Android phone with just enough knobs on to make me wait even more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Head on over to the Vodafone site to sign-up for notification when the Desire is launched.</p>
