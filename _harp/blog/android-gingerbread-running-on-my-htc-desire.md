<p>Thanks to the brilliant Richard Trip, whose <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=690477">DeFroST ROM</a> I use every day on my phone, we now also have the a rough cut of <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=880465">Gingerbread on the Desire</a>. Initial impressions are that not much has changed except for some bling. I know most of the changes are under the hood. Seems to be rock solid. Haven&#39;t found any problems yet.</p>
