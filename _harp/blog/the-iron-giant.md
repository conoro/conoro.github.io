#"The Iron Giant"


    <p>A new Top Parenting Tip, keep your kids up until 9pm watching <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Iron_Giant">The Iron Giant</a> and they'll all sleep until 8.30am the following morning.</p>
<p>Until last night I had only ever seen the start and near the end of movie so had thought it was a dark ponderous but meaningful piece by the director of one of my all-time favourite movies, The Incredibles. I was totally wrong. It's light, funny, interesting and kept 6 of us (aged 3, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 41) riveted to the screen for an hour and a half.</p>

<p>They didn't even mind that the movie was "old-fashioned" (1999) and set in the "olden-days" (1957).</p>
<p>It's a rare movie that has something for every age with Toy Story being the exemplar of that. This achieves the same feat and manages to shoe-horn in a message there too.</p>
