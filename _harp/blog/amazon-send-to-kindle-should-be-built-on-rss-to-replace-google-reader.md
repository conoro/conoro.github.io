#"Amazon \"Send to Kindle\" should be built on RSS to replace Google Reader"

I've seen a few mentions today of a new "<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/19/amazon-launches-send-to-kindle-button-for-web-developers-wordpress-blogs/">Send to Kindle</a>" button that you can add to your site/blog. It means people can send clips of your web content to their fave e-reader.

It just struck me that Amazon is missing a serious trick with the Kindle here. An RSS-based reader which works on E-ink, Fire, Android and Cloud Reader could be something awesome. Whilst I use some web-clipping services like Pocket, I much prefer to subscribe to sites. Being able to click a Kindle button that I know is also an RSS button would make me very happy indeed.

Now that Google wants to kill RSS in favour of G+ in a classic but doomed Microsoft-style embrace/extend/extinguish, this could be a big opportunity for Amazon to both attract all the old GReader userbase and turn RSS into a mainstream Subscribe Button. Like we all thought RSS would be, back in 2006.

I'd love to have all my RSS feeds synced to my old-school Kindle. It's ideal for medium-to-long-form content. Give it offline reading capability and I'm sold.

In contrast, I doubt I'll be adding their current button to any of my blogs unless ShareThis adds it as a default.
