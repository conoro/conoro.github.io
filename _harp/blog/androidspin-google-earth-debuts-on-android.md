    <p>Looks like Google is starting to pull a Nokia on it by not supporting "older" v1.6 phones like, for example, the not-yet-released Sony Ericsson Xperia X10.
</p><p>Yeah yeah it's presumably due to HTML5 being needed. So release a v1.6x with HTML5. Oh, @Cyanogen already has. You do understand you have developer community Google, don't you? I thought that was the point of Android being "open".
</p><p>Off to boot into OpenEclair on the G1 so I can check out Earth.</p></div>
