<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">XBOX users also have  access to arguably the best media center application on any platform.  XBMC started because the XBOX needed a good media player, but it evolved  into something so much larger. Streaming media files from the network  with library organization, weather support, XBOX game trainers, a  game/program launcher, and an entire build of python to run a plethora  of scripts which can be created by anyone. XBMC has been unsurpassed by  many other media applications, some of which you must pay for.</blockquote>

<p>I always love it when CE devices last way beyond their intended  obsolescence date. We still have two XBOXes which are used daily as XBMC  media players.</p>
<p>Both bought secondhand, both hacked, both utterly brilliant. The  most recent version of XBOX4XBMC was only released a while back.</p>
<p>We'll keep using them until the majority of video becomes MP4, which unfortunately they usually don't have enough welly to play.</p>
