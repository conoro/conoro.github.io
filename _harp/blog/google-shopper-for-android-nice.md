    <p>Another area I knew they would eventually invade. Google Goggles made into a useful product. US focussed now but give it time.
</p><p>What ever happened to Compare Everywhere? For a long time it vied with Shopsavvy in this space and then disappeared out of the Android Market. Did Google buy it?
</p><p>Of course Voice Search is still a bit flakey. I tried "Google Nexus One" twice and it came back with "Connexus Corp" and "Lexus".</p></div>
