#"iGo Stowaway Keyboard and iPad 2 = Awesome"


 <p>Wayyyy back in Feb 2008, the iGo Stowaway keyboard was being end-of-lined due to its non-HID compatibility and I managed to snare one for &pound;18 in the UK. It had previously been north of &pound;100.</p>
<p>It's one of the best purchases I've ever made. Over the years I have used it with a Nokia N770 tablet, an N95-8GB phone, a HTC Desire, Boxee/XBMC on our TV PC and now, drum-roll, hurrah, it works on the iPad2 too!</p>

<p>Yes of couse it's as stable as a ball on top of a cone in that config, but with the iPad tilted up on the smartcase, it works beautifully too.</p>
<p>Now to jailbreak the iPad so that I'm in control of it, instead of Steve from beyond the grave.</p>
