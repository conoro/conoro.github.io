    <p>It took Twitter nearly 4 years to get even remotely recognised or understood by normal people. From what I can see, Foursquare is going to do the same in less than 18 months (someone find me a Moore's law analogy there).
</p><p>They now have Bravo TV in the US promoting it. And any ad that has Padma Lakshmi in it, is a winner in my book.
</p><p>The branded badges in Foursquare are genius. A win-win-win. The brands get advertising, Foursquare gets revenue and brand junkies get recognised for their fandom (also see post yesterday about Paul Carr's Guiltvault).
</p><p>I had thought all of these LBS guys were dead with the arrival of Buzz. But Google has fucked that launch up so badly, it's racing towards the magical world of Orkut/Latitude/Dodgeball/Jaiku/Froogle/Base/Notebook.</p></div>
