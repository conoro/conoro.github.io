#"I've never met an Engineer who could turn their hand to business"


    <p>With that one line by Alan Sugar on last night's UK Apprentice, I finally realised why Amstrad was never able to grow beyond the odd burst of short term opportunism into a global company. I'd like to run a few numbers past Lord Sugar:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Number of Amstrad Music Devices sold last year: 0</li>
<li>Number of Apple Music Devices sold last year: 84m&nbsp;</li>
<li>Market share of phones with e-m@ailer technology: 0%</li>
<li>Market share of phones with ARM technology: 98% globally</li>
<li>Dell market cap: $30.18B</li>
<li> Viglen valuation: &pound;9.99?</li>
<li>Amstrad sale price: &pound;127m</li>
<li>Scientific Atlanta Sale Price: $6.9B</li>
</ul>
<div>The one difference between those companies and Amstrad? Great business people with a global vision working with great engineers with business sense.</div>
<p />
<div>So Lord Sugar, the next time an engineer runs a business or product idea past you, maybe stop thinking about how you can bundle a tape-recorder with it, and listen to her.</div>
</div>
<p />
<div>Wouldn't it be great if the BBC dropped property developer Alan from the Apprentice and replaced him with&nbsp;Herman Hauser&nbsp;who, with the creation of the BBC Micro, is ultimately responsible for what became ARM, a technology that is in nearly every mobile phone on the planet? That's someone I would like my kids to aspire to emulating.</div>
<p />
<div>Herman, by the way, is a Fellow of The Royal Academy of Engineering.</div>
