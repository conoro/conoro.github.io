#"Google Says Hello to Jason Isaacs"

Ah this is just lovely. As anyone who listens to Kermode and Mayo's film reviews on BBC Radio 5 Live (mostly via podcast) knows, they say hello to Jason Isaacs almost every week.

It has become a bit of a meme with people trying to do the same via ever more interesting ways, including the rolling credits on the spoof news on the Jay Leno show.

But Google just beat everyone. One of their Search engineers in Mountain View is a fan of the show and has adjusted the results on his name. I think it only works on .co.uk

Love it!
