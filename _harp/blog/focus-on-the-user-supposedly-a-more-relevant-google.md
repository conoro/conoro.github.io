#"Focus on the User - Supposedly a more \"relevant\" Google"

<blockquote>How much better would social search be if Google surfaced results from all across the web? The results speak for themselves. We created a tool that uses Googles own relevance measurethe ranking of their organic search resultsto determine what social content should appear in the areas where Google+ results are currently hardcoded.

All of the information in this demo comes from Google itself, and all of the ranking decisions are made by Google's own algorithms. No other services or APIs are accessed.</blockquote>

A funny pointed site by some Facebook, MySpace and Twitter Engineers. Of course, if Facebook and Twitter just let Google index them instead, maybe Goog wouldn't show a preference for its own site.......

I think I'll use the bookmarklet anyway for kicks n giggles.
