#"Using the Amazon Appstore from outside the US (including paid apps) - Android @ MoDaCo"

      <blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">The Amazon Appstore launched recently and it's very cool, but unfortunately it's limited to US customers, leaving the rest of us out in the cold. Which sucks. BUT, there are ways around it! Successfully using the Appstore relies on you having a US presence - a US credit card, a US address and a US phone number (handily, not a US IP), but there are ways to meet this criteria.</blockquote>

    <p>Great catch by Paul. It was the US Credit Card bit that I hadn't been able to figure out.</p></div>
