<p>Quick update on my outdoor broadband antenna story. I ordered a Huawei E176 broadband dongle on eBay from Hong Kong and a connector from Solwise in the UK two weeks ago. Connector arrived last week. Huawei just arrived. It means I should be able to get very solid HSDPA/HSUPA using the outdoor antenna. Will test as soon as it stops raining (June). </p><p /><div>Quick pic of dongle plus connector. It seems the dongle casing is interfering with fully plugging in the connector. Nothing a stanley knife can&#39;t cure.</div><p /><div>If you are going this route, the E176 seems to be the best one to get. Very few of the Huaweis seem to have external connectors and many of those that do, don&#39;t handle the higher speed HSUPA upload.</div>
