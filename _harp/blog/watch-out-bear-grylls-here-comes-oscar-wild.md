#"Watch out Bear Grylls, here comes Oscar Wild"

Our 12 y/o son, named after the Grouch, not the playwright, has been making lots of funny short videos in the past year with his friends in the estate. But today's deserved a blogpost all of its own.

Watch and enjoy.

Tech notes: He uses a <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0038WATL2/ref=wms_ohs_product">Sanyo Xacti HD Camcorder</a>on a cheap tripod I got in Argos years ago. They then edit on a low-end laptop using <a href="http://www.pinnaclesys.com/PublicSite/us/Products/Consumer+Products/Home+Video/Studio+Family/Studio+Ultimate+15.htm">Pinnacle Studio Ultimate</a>. The lack of welly, memory and dedicated GPU in the i3 laptop is starting to become an issue for him so I'll probably be donating my self-built quad-core Phenom desktop later in the year. Particularly if they keep up the quality like this.

Also, not a bad English accent for a jackeen blow-in to West Cork aged 5.
