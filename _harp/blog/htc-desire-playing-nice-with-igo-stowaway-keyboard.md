<p>I got an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Stowaway-Ultra-Slim-Bluetooth-Keyboard-Handhelds/dp/B0002OKCXE">iGo Stowaway Keyboard</a> nearly three years ago for my Nokia N95-8GB and N770 at a knock-down price. I still think it is one of the greatest pieces of industrial design out there. It never got huge use but was invaluable when I really needed it. For the past few months I&#39;ve used it as the keyboard for our <a href="http://www.boxee.tv/">Boxee</a> PC.</p><p /><div>I&#39;m heading up to cover the <a href="http://www.dublinwebsummit.com/">Dublin Web Summit</a> for <a href="http://www.web2ireland.org/">Web2Ireland</a> tomorrow and I&#39;m in no mood to lug around a laptop and spare batteries. So the thought struck me &quot;I wonder can I get the iGo working with my Android phone?&quot;. A bunch of googling showed me to be very late to the party. There are a lot of iGo fanatics and people have been trying to get this working since the G1 came out.</div> <p /><div>It appears that Google dropped the ball on Keyboard/Mouse support in Android and only barely support it now. However I found an app/driver called <a href="http://www.teksoftco.com/index.php?section=blueinputandroid">BlueInput</a> which gets the iGo talking to my HTC Desire. It&#39;s not exactly perfect with lots of problems around numbers, punctuation etc, but hell, 9.99 beats the 80 that a new compatible fold-up keyboard would cost.</div> <p /><div>So I&#39;ll be easy to spot as the total dork phone-blogging tomorrow!</div>
