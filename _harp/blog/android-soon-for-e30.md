#"Android soon for \u008030?"


    Finally got my two-year upgrade on Vodafone Ireland. Had a look at what&#39;s on offer. N97-mini for 120 is good value but I hate resistive screens and the lack of memory.<p />Oh, what&#39;s this? The Vodafone H1 360 for 30? A linux-based phone, social media enabled, 5 MP camera, wifi, 3G, bluetooth, Cortex A8 kick-ass CPU, lots of memory. Is that a typo? No, it is 30.<p /> Read some reviews (particularly Ewan on Mobile Industry Review). Damn, the software is a horror. Crappy apps too.<p />A wee bit of Googling. Yes! Someone had the same idea as me. Port Android to it.<p />The hackers have barely got started but if they manage it, you could have something that has the equivalent hardware of a Nexus One, running Android. For 30.<p /> Poor Vodafone. I could have told them for free that they should have done that in the first place. Or buy Palm and use WebOS. <p />Not this badly thought out, badly implemented, will-probably-get the-bullet-when-the-bungee-VP-moves-on-to-his-next-gig disaster.
