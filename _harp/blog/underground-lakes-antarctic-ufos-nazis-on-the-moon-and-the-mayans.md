#"Underground Lakes, Antarctic UFOs, Nazis on The Moon and The Mayans"

It's a funny old week when all of the above come together in your head isn't it? Bear with me for a sec.

As we all know, The Mayans predicted the world would end in 2012. This ties nicely into the long-awaited B-movie Iron Sky coming in April - "In 1945 the Nazis went to the Moon. In 2012 they're coming back". Or something.

Then we hear that the Russians have finally <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-16907998">drilled into Lake Vostok</a> in Antarctica, releasing a likely plague of alienlife-form...movies.

These three reminded me of a sci-fi book I read as a young teenager. Probably one that my Dad picked up in an airport in the early 80s. Of course I couldn't remember the name of it and spent 30 minutes googling variations of "ufo, nazis, antarctica, sci-fi". Finally I found it, Genesis!

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/GENESIS-ebook/dp/B004LLIF92/ref=tmm_kin_title_0?ie=UTF8&amp;m=AG56TWVU5XWC2"><img class="size-full wp-image-579 aligncenter" title="b59e81b0c8a05ffb5a8a8110.L" src="http://conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/b59e81b0c8a05ffb5a8a8110.L.jpg" alt="" width="251" height="400" /></a>

That plot has stuck in my head for the guts of 30 years. Brilliant, twisted and right on the edge of believable. Overly wordy sure, but he pressed all my teenage buttons.

But then it got even better as I looked the author <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._A._Harbinson">W.A. Harbinson</a> up yesterday and discovered that he's from Northern Ireland and now lives in West Cork!!! He's <del datetime="2012-02-12T12:34:51+00:00">82</del> 70 years old and I think he deserves a resurgence.

You'll never get a paper copy of the book now but brilliantly, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/GENESIS-ebook/dp/B004LLIF92/ref=tmm_kin_title_0?ie=UTF8&amp;m=AG56TWVU5XWC2">you can get it on Kindle</a>. It's only $4. Trust me, you'll love it, even if you hate it.

I've also thought for 30 years that it would make an amazing movie. Go on, someone, do it.

UPDATE: W.A. Harbinson has left a comment below, which was a lovely surprise on a Saturday night. He also linked <a href="http://www.waharbinson.eu.com/">to his own site</a> which I was not aware of. It has info on some of his more recent books too, which are avalable as downloads.
