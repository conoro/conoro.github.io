    <p>As opposed to Decency Filters :-)
</p><p>I've only just started playing with the feature and amazingly, it isn't just the best implementation on a mobile, it's the best implementation anywhere. 
</p><p>Your can mute people, hashtags or keywords.
</p><p>Tweetdeck, Seesmic et al should be ashamed of themselves for the lack of progress in this area on the desktop.
</p><p>Speaking of which there is a Chrome plugin for Twitter which does filtering called Slipstream. I tried it out but it only allows one exact word/phrase per filter and only works on twitter.com. Worth a look tho if that's all you need.</p></div>
