#"Facebook is removing App Profile Pages - This affects a lot of Devs"


    <div class="posterous_bookmarklet_entry">
      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote">Today, we are announcing that we will remove all App Profile Pages on February 1st, 2012. Though similar in appearance, the automatically generated App Profile Pages differ in features from traditional <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages">Facebook Pages</a>, and over time the inconsistencies between the two, such as different Insights, APIs, and distribution channels, have become more apparent.</blockquote>

    <p>If you have an App that you add to Pages as a Tab by sending Page Owners to the App's own Profile Page, then you need to change how you do things.
</p><p>The easiest way is the URL example they give. You can set that up and just tell people to go there and click on the Page which needs the Tab.
</p><p>Probably a bigger documentation issue for companies like ours rather than being a technical issue.</p></div>
