#"Kindle for Kids Must Be Coming Soon"


 <p>Sibal, our 7 y/o, just read a sample chapter of Judy Moody on my Kindle. Some of the words were beyond her and we made good use of the dictionary feature which is pretty decent.</p> <p>But it struck me that a &quot;Kid Mode&quot; would be 100x more useful. It would give a child-friendly pop-up explanation plus optional audio pronounciation. Basically what the VTech Storio does but at Amazon scale.</p> <p>Next logical step would be cool kid designs on the devices and a kid-only Kindle Store.</p>
