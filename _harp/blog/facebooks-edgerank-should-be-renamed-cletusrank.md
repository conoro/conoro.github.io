<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">The reason newspapers are dying is because people don't want others picking old news for them...........so Facebook decides it wants to pick old news for me.&nbsp;<p /> This isn't a "ooh I don't like the layout" complaint, this is fundamental to users being in control of what they see on the internet.&nbsp;<p />How funny is it that the only way I can see that very interesting F8 update is in the tiny News ticker on the right?<p /> If I plug Facebook into Tweetdeck, do I get my chronology back?<p />@conoro on Twitter if you are looking for me. I'll be the one reading what I choose to read.</blockquote>
