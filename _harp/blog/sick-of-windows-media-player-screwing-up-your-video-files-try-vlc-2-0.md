#"Sick of Windows Media Player screwing up your video files? Try VLC 2.0"

I love <a href="http://www.videolan.org/">VLC</a>. It's a media player than can handle any piece of crap video you throw at it. When WMP can't keep audio/video in sync for more than a minute, VLC nails it. There is an incredible set of features in there, of which I have only barely scratched the surface.

But, and it's a big but, the UI was designed by a blind person. Or a sadist. Or a blind sadist.

We've read all about the new UI in VLC 2.0 for Mac but I just installed the PC one and it's the same old horror. A pity since some of the new features include faster decoding on multi-core and GPUs and even more formats andBluRay Disc support.

Still, I'm sticking with it as it has never let me down. Would love to figure out UPNP on it tho.
