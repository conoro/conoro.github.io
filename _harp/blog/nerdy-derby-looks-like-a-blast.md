<blockquote>The <a href="http://nerdyderby.com/">Nerdy Derby</a> is a no-rules* miniature car building and racing competition inspired by the Cub Scouts' Pinewood Derby. With a larger, more undulating track and no restrictions on the size of the cars or materials participants can use, the Nerdy Derby rewards creativity, cleverness and ingenuity.

The first-ever Nerdy Derby will take place at <a href="http://makerfaire.com/">World Maker Faire New York</a> on September 29th and 30th at the New York Hall of Science in Queens. Visitors can bring their own cars to race, choose from a selection of pre-built cars, or make their cars on site in our workshop.</blockquote>
