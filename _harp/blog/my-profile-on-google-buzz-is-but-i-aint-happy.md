#"My Profile on Google Buzz is...., but I ain't happy"


    Right, I&#39;m in playing with Google Buzz on the Desktop and I don&#39;t like it but I&#39;ll keep at it for a while. It&#39;s Friendfeed 2.0, and we all know what a roaring success that was.<p /><div>A bigger problem is the lack of GoogApps account support. I have driven all my mail through that account for the past three years. Now I have to revert to an old semi-dead GMail account to use Buzz. <p /><div>So do I build up a network on Buzz there and in 3 months time Google announces &quot;Yay we now support Google Apps in Buzz&quot; and I have to start all over again?</div><p /><div>Identity in Google in totally broken. I have a LouderVoice Goog Apps account and I have exactly the same email address as a Google Profile but not as GMail. So I can log in some places with GoogApps, some places with the Goog Profile and others with the old GMail account.</div> <p /><div>Even in Android, which does accept Goog Apps accounts, if I try and use that account in Google Voice on the Android phone, it tells me to piss off and use a GMail account. Ditto the Amazon MP3 store.</div> <p /><div>Does <b>anyone</b>in Google talk to <b>anyone</b> else?</div><div></div><div>Oh yeah.</div><p /><div><a href="http://www.google.com/profiles/cwjoneill">http://www.google.com/profiles/cwjoneill</a></div> <p /><div>But perhaps not forever.</div><p /><div>Any chance I can change that to conoro or conoroneill? Nah, didn&#39;t think so. Too busy boiling the ocean to add useful features.</div><p /> </div>
