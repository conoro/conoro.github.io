#"Really Amazon, my Facebook Friends like Monty Python? Wow!"


    <p>You can now connect your Amazon account to your Facebook account. The idea being that stuff your friends like might also appeal to you.</p>
<p>I'm not so sure when it comes to purchasing.</p>
<p>I don't have the same taste in movies as my wife, I'm not a vegan like my old college buddy Bernard, I don't read the same books as my nephew Tadhg and I'm not a big fan of pets like my sisters.</p>
<p>But hey, I'm a click-junkie so I set it up and this is what it gave me:</p>

A bunch of blindingly obvious "You're 42, of course you like The Godfather" plus some movies in Mandarin Chinese. Pretty much what I expected (apart from the Mandarin). Nothing along the lines of "wow, never heard of that book, must buy it".</p>
<p>I'll take "people who bought the product you just added to your basket also bought......" any day over this.</p>
<p>I'll now bang on about my favourite topic "filters" for a moment. I was taking the mickey out of Facebook last night due to their Page recommendations in the sidebar, they are hilarious. Here are some of them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many who like House also like Bones</li>
<li>Many who like Music also like Movies</li>
<li>Many who like Comedy also like Drama</li>
<li>Many who like Tea also like Breffmania</li>
<li>Many who like Shopping Malls also like Comtemporary R&amp;B</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem is lack of filtering. I actually like the Breffmania one because it is non-obvious and adds a little discoverability. Amazon telling me that my friends like Monty Python is about as interesting as saying they like TV.?</p>
<p>Purchasing is not the same as Liking YouTube clips or sharing jokes.Something far more powerful like <a href="http://hunch.com/">Hunch</a> is required.</p>
<p>And as I said on Facebook earlier, I'm be stunned if FB doesn't buy them this year.</p>
