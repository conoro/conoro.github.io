#"Does Skype hate its customers?"


 <p>With every new release of Skype it gets slower and slower and buggier and buggier. But that's not the worst of it. I pay them for both inbound numbers and for a lot of call charges. Yet every damned morning when I get up, this stupid message greets me.</p>
<p />
<div>And that's after un-ticking all of the "of course I want you to try and sell me more shit" boxes.</div>
<p />
<div>I'd move to another solution but so many people I communicate with use it now for the free Skype-to-Skype, so I can't.&nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>And they obviously know that.</div>
