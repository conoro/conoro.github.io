#"Quick Call Cost Comparison of Eircom, Skype, Blueface, Google Voice and Rebtel"


    <p>We run all of our business phone comms on Blueface (Irish number), Skype (UK number) and Google Voice (US Number). I was doing some checking on dial-out pricing on those services and others over the weekend and collected this initial pricing comparison. Thought it might be useful. Note that these are all Pay As You Go prices, except Eircom which is the home Talktime Chatter package. Most of them offer big discounts if you pay a monthly sub.</p>
<p />
<div>All prices in Euro Cent, per minute, daytime rate, including VAT where applicable.</div>

<div><strong>National Landlines</strong></div>
<div><span style="font-family: courier new, monospace;">Eircom &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 8.57</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: courier new, monospace;">Blueface &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1.9</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: courier new, monospace;">Skype &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2.2</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: courier new, monospace;">Google Voice &nbsp; &nbsp; 1.4</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: courier new, monospace;">Rebtel &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1.5</span></div>

<div><span style="font-family: courier new, monospace;">Eircom &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 21.91</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: courier new, monospace;">Blueface &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 18</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: courier new, monospace;">Skype &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;20.1</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: courier new, monospace;">Google Voice &nbsp; &nbsp; 14</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: courier new, monospace;">Rebtel &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 14.7</span></div>
</div>
<p />
<div>So bizarrely, Google Voice, a service which is not officially available in Ireland, is the cheapest of the lot with <a href="http://www.rebtel.com/">Rebtel</a> running them a very close second. &nbsp;If you had to pay VAT on GV, Rebtel wins. The Rebtel Android App is very impressive. I think I'll use them for calls this week. Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/johnpeavoy">John Peavoy</a> for the tip.</div>
