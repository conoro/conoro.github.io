#"Google using Google+ to up-sell Google Apps"

I saw this in the control panel for one of my Google Apps for Your Domain accounts today.

The value-add for paid accounts on Google Apps has always been very poor. $50 per user for a few tweaks most people don't need. This could change things, particularly for those who want to use Google+ as a replacement for Yammer.
