 <p>A typically OTT post from Jason but some important points in the hyperbole.
</p><p>We're massive fans of Facebook Connect and Twitter OAuth, not as replacements for businesses owning their data and its context, but as adjuncts, as marketing tools.
</p><p>Whether you are a business or an individual, Social Networks should be where you send _copies_ of things to. Own your pictures, opinions, reviews, poems, videos and memories. Share them using these tools.</p></div>
