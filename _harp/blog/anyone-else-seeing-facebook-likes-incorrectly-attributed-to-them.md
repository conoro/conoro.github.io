#"Anyone else seeing Facebook Likes incorrectly attributed to them?"


    I think Facebook may have a big bug on their hands. I just Liked the Obama computer video on Gawker. It&#39;s showing up in my stream. But it is also showing up as Liked by my wife who is on the same router. She never clicked Like on it.<p /><div>So either there is some IP address NAT weirdness going on with Facebook or there is a screw-up related to cookie somewhere on this notebook from months back, which would be the last time she used this computer. <p /><div>Anyone else seeing weirdness?</div><p /></div>
