    <p>In yesterday's post about podcast listening I mentioned that I use A2DP  bluetooth to my car stereo. The latest version of that stereo is going to be in Lidl this Thursday on 11/02. Highly recommended except for the terrible radio reception in West Cork.
</p><p>70 is a total bargain for this.
</p><p>Many cars will need an adapter to hook their speakers etc into the ISO connection on the Lidl box. Ditto the antenna connector. Leave a comment if you want links to where to buy those and I'll fish them out. Only a few quid.</p></div>
