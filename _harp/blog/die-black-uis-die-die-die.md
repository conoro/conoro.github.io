#"Die, Black UIs, Die Die Die"


 <p>I mentioned this on Twitter over the past two days. I absolutely hate black-heavy user-interfaces on anything. It was prompted by my trial of the soon-to-be-released Ubuntu 10.04.</p>
<p>All previous versions of Ubuntu had a colour scheme even more offensive than black: pooh brown. It's the first thing I change whenever I install it.&nbsp;I was really happy to see the purple boot screen on this new version of Ubuntu but that turned to horror when it finally loaded and everything else was black.</p>
<p>The black default is why I don't use Tweetdeck. Ditto Twibble on the N95-8GB. Yes I've tried dicking around with the colour scheme but life is too short. Let's not forget Vista too.</p>
<p>Why do I hate black? Because, as I said to @belazir, these are the words I think of when I encounter a black UI:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;">Dark</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;">Forboding</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;">Uninviting</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;">Sleazy</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;">Nasty</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;">Illegal</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;">Warez</span></li>
</ul>
<p>So yay for black clothes to make people look sexy. But boo to black UIs that make us all look like script-kiddies.</p>
