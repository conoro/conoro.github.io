<p>Really pleased with how well this is working with the N770 tablets and Mediatomb running on EEbuntu. Now going to try Android, iPhone and N95-8GB a streaming clients. Have already got it working with Windows Media Player. Less success on the Linux video players without hacking.</p>
<p>If someone knows how to lock the N770 screen without causing the video to pause and creating a catch-22, let me know.</p>
