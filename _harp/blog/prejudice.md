#"Prejudice"


    I would generally prefer to gouge my ear drums out with a rusty nail than be subjected to comedians who do &quot;funny&quot; songs. Singing comedians are like musical theatre, good at neither.<p />But Tim Minchin did make me giggle recently on Jonathan Ross. Then last night I saw this and he made laugh out loud. Several times. Superb.<p /> <iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/z1HXmYkxwSE?wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen frameborder="0" height="417" width="500"></iframe>
