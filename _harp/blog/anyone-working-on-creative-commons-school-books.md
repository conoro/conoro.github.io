#"Anyone working on Creative Commons School Books?"


    The cost of schoolbooks remains an enormous problem for a lot of people. If you have more than one child, you can rarely do hand-me-downs, particularly in Secondary School. The publishers relentlessly issue new versions that are different enough to make it impossible to have multiple editions in one classroom.<p /><div>Given that Maths, History, English, Irish, Physics etc, don&#39;t actually change much except with curriculum changes, does it not make sense for community-minded Irish educators to work together and generate Creative Commons versions of books? Or is it only we geeks who do things like that?</div>
