    <p>I did a running commentary during the announcement on Twitter. Not convinced by the Desktop stuff but the mobile bit is brilliant and I'd be crapping myself in any Local-focused site.
</p><p>Read this stuff in reverse order:
</p><p>@dermotcasey I'm unconvinced by the desktop stuff. But mobile blew my socks off.
</p><p>No update for Google Maps in Android Market. C'monnnnnnnnnn #buzz
</p><p>Forget all my negative stuff about the desktop side. Google actually has me really excited by the mobile aspects of #buzz.
</p><p>Oh shit it's Gillmor. Wait for him to ask Sergey if they have implemented Track in #buzz
</p><p>Gowalla picked the wrong day to roll out an API. Yesterday might have been a smidge better :-) #buzz
</p><p>I said it over a year ago after seeing @marissamayer at @leweb , Google will own Local. That new mobile #buzz stuff is incredible.
</p><p>OK, the mobile app integrating into Place Pages is a killer. Nice. Maybe Yelp shudda took the money.
</p><p>So Google simultaneously going after Facebook, Twitter, Friendfeed, Foursquare, Yelp and Gowalla. Boiling the ocean.
</p><p>Ouch ouch ouch. New Google Maps for Symbian, WiMo and Android. "Other platforms coming". Sticking it to the Steve.
</p><p>Vic thinks they are called "Tweeds" not Tweets. Screw your algorithms. I want filters! That I create. Human not machine. Geddit?
</p><p>So Google is adding a bunch of features that Facebook is deprecating like auto-suggesting best content. Welcome to 2008.
</p><p>"The @ reply is a feature that is becoming popular on the web". He can't even say Twitter. Jesus. Buzz = Non-Enterprise Google Wave?
</p><p>Google Buzz. How many poxy products have had that name. Including Yahoo. Up there with Bing.</p></div>
