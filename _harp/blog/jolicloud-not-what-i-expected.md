#"Jolicloud not what I expected"


    <p>So after checking out CloudOS, I loaded up JoliCloud onto a thumbdrive. Tariq Krim's quick presentation at Le Web had caught my interest.<p />I was a bit stunned to find myself booting into Ubuntu NBR Linux. And not quickly. Hardly a new paradigm.<p /> I create a Jolicloud account and.............<p />"Here are some apps you can install in your linux box. Here are some other webapps, not specific to Jolicloud"<p />I honestly don't get it. Mozilla Prism to run some web-apps offline. Anddddddddd?<p /> A Cloud based Netbook needs to boot in 10 seconds or less and offer me something new, not just an aggregation of other people's bits.<p />If Jolicloud is HTML5 etc (like Palm Pre) that is a good thing. But it doesn't strike me as a business that can compete with Google and everyone else who offers the same thing on e.g. a stripped down Win7</p>
