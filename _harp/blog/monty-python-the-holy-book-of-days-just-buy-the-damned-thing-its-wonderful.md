#"Monty Python: The Holy Book of Days - Just buy the damned thing, it's wonderful"

I'm not quite sure how to explain <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/monty-python-holy-book-days/id503975422?mt=8">this</a>.

If you (like me) have all Three Volumes of "Monty Python's Flying Circus, All the Words" then I think you may have to buy yourself an iPad <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/monty-python-holy-book-days/id503975422?mt=8">just for this</a>.

It's an interactive day-by-day guide to the creation of The Holy Grail. Which makes it sound like some Philips CD-i thing from 1988. But it's much much worse (i.e. better).

Every little possible titbit is included and a huge amount of it has never been made public before. There is a very funny intro from John Cleese on how it has taken him decades to forget the horror of making the movie and now it's all come flooding back.

There is some syncronisation thingy to internet-enabled Blu-Ray players which means I'm going to have to buy the bloody Blue-Ray now too.

Only a fiver. If they make one for Life of Brian, I'll pay whatever they ask for.

Any chance we can have on Android too?
