    <p>I just installed this and gave it a go. Works perfectly with our Sky+HD. Only glitch was that we have two boxes and I needed to login to the Sky site to tell it which one to record with.
</p><p>App is giving plenty of "bad connection" errors but always works on the second attempt. 
</p><p>Looks lovely and can be region set to Ireland.</p></div>
