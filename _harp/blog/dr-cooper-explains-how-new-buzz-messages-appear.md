#"Dr Cooper explains how new Buzz messages appear"


 <p>The most infuriating aspect of Buzz (and boy are there lots of them) is how a comment by some random stranger on a message by some stranger you follow, is considered so urgently important that it immediately jumps to the top of your page. I've said it before and I'll say it again, this product could never have been tested by anyone with more than about 3 friends.</p>
