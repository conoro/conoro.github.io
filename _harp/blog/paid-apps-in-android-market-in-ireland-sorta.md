#"Paid Apps in Android Market in Ireland, Sorta."


    Just spotted from <a href="http://twitter.com/Popple3">@Popple3</a> via <a href="http://twitter.com/jkeyes">@jkeyes</a> that he can see paid apps on his Irish Android phone (Meteor). I also just got a mail from Google telling me that lots more countries will be rolled out in the coming weeks. Someone finally banged the appropriate heads together.<p /><div>But it looks like the Irish thing may be network specific for the moment. I ain&#39;t got diddly on my Vodafone SIM despite a few reboots so I&#39;m stuck using my 3UK SIM trick to install Paid Apps.</div><p /><div>In any case, great news for Android owners in Ireland and one less reason to hold off on buying an Android phone. Now if only Vodafone would launch the HTC Desire Z in Ireland so I can get it for my Dad.</div> <div></div>
