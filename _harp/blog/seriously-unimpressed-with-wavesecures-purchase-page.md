I just signed up for what I thought was an <strong>Annual </strong>Subscription to <a href="https://www.wavesecure.com/buy.aspx">Wavesecure</a> on Android. How would you read the above screen? It looks to me like I have selected 12 months and the the 3 month option has been disabled. But after purchase I saw that my subscription runs out in October.</p>
<p>So somehow I have bought a 3-month Annual Subscription? Are they kidding?</p>
<p>I'd be less pissed off if I could actually get the thing to do a backup but it just gives "Network Errror" over and over, despite every other app on the phone having no problem with the network.</p>
<p>And $19 for three months of phone backup is just silly money.</p>
<p>Andddddd, you can't even buy the bloody thing on your phone, you have to do it on a PC.</p>
<p>Avoid.</p>
