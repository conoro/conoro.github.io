#"Zoho CRM integration into Google Apps just got even better"


 <p>I'm a massive fan of Zoho CRM. Inexpensive but jamemd full of features. I've barely scratched the surface of it. Its Goog Apps integration is the best I've seen. Full two-way integration with GMail.</p>
<p>I was looking at it today to see if it had Helpdesk functionality and found that it did. But Zoho also has a separate app called Creator Helpdek so I needed to figure out which one to use.</p>
<p>I started doing the Helpdesk-&gt;Google Apps integration steps and got stuck. It just sits there saying "Installing Zoho Creator Helpdesk". But as I followed the steps I noticed a message in the Google Apps Dashboard saying that CRM wanted a bunch of new permissions. I accepted the request but wasn't sure if it would give any new functionality.</p>
<p>Then I saw this:</p>

<p>Then I clicked on the Go button:</p>
