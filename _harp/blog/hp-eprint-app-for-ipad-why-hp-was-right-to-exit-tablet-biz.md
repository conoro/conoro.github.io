I helped my Dad setup printing from his iPad to his HP wireless printer over the Christmas. The easiest way is just to email the private address of the printer using the HP ePrint service. But I spotted that they have an iPad App too and I installed it.

Oh dear god. An ususable, counter-intuitive steaming pile of garbage. It doesn't even have a Wizard to help you setup. Just a blank screen and some buttons.

I finally sorted it out after 15 minutes of messing. And then reverted to using the email method.

I'd like to congratulate HP on killing the TouchPad. Even they realised that they haven't the first clue how tablets work.
