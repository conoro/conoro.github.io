#"Microsoft really taking Node.js seriously"


 <p><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;">We're now on the Microsoft BizSpark program and one thing I want to try out over the next few weeks is getting our Node.js+MongoDB back-end running on Azure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;">I <a href="https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/downloads/">spotted this yesterday</a> on the Node mailing list and it shows how Microsoft now lists Node after .Net but before Java and PHP! It's now "Tier 1" inside MSFT which is fantastic news.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;">There is also a <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/Windows-Azure-Developer-Experience-Videos/Nodejs-Windows-Azure-Introduction">very very cool video</a> by Steve Marx introducing Node on Azure, if you want to see how it all works. I was stunned how easy it was. And both npm and Express work fine!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;">Anyone know what the story is with WebSockets tho? That was a limitation in first release of Cloud Foundry but I don't know if it still is or if it is on Azure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;">Very interesting to see Steve using <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> as his editor. I bought v2 of this recently and absolutely love it. Seen by many as a Textmate for Windows.</span></p>
