#"Experimental GIMP for Windows in Single-Window Mode"

We use <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a> for all of our basic bitmap manipulations. Whether it's changing the colour of stars or modifying logos for Facebook Connect, it gets the job done brilliantly. I've tried many others like Paint.net and nothing comes close. But as anyone who has used it knows, they have had that horrible multi-window setup for years.

I went looking earlier to see if there had been any progress on GIMP in general. I read a scathing post a good while back basically saying RIP GIMP since it was still only able to do 8-bit colour depth. But after a bit of searching I found that things have been moving along, albeit very slowly. The new versions sounded fab but the official site didn't have any of them for Windows. A bit more searching and I found some <a href="http://graphicall.org/351">experimental builds</a> including one for Windows 7 64-bit.

And so far, it's working great! Single-Window Mode yay.
