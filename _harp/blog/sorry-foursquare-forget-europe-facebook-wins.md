#"Sorry Foursquare, Forget Europe, Facebook Wins"


    <p>I normally wouldn't call a result a few days after a new release but bloody hell, Facebook Places has gone mental in Ireland in less than a week. And I'm not talking about geeks. Most of the people I am friends with on Facebook have never heard of Foursquare or Gowalla and yet they are checking in all over the place on FB. It's amazing to watch.</p>
<p>How many years have we banged on about Location Based Services to no avail outside of the early adopter brigade?</p>
<p>All Facebook has to do now to keep the momentum going is to get deals/discounts in place everywhere.</p>
<p>I have been a dedicated 4SQ user since it launched here and an intermittent Gowalla user but I honestly think I'll be giving up on both over the next few weeks.</p>
<p>I'll finally get my thoughts down here in the next few days about why Facebook Places will slaughter Google Places too.</p>
