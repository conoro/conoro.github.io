#"Ah c'mon, is this not the cutest @raspberry_pi setup of all time?"

I splashed out a little on my main dev Raspberry Pi and finally got it a <a href="http://shop.pimoroni.com/collections/pibow/products/pibow">PiBow case</a>. I've loved that design for so long, I had to succumb.

Coincidentally the same company now has a brilliant new USB hub specifically for the RPi called <a href="http://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pihub">the PiHUB</a>. Not only is it in that hilarious shape, but it also comes with a 3A PSU. This means you can add extra devices and power the Raspberry Pi off it. So far it's been the most compatible hub I've tried with the RPi and we all know how dodgy it can be with hubs. It also solves the USB-splitter-cable mess I had devised to connect a portable harddrive to the RPi.

Another thing I got from Pimoroni was an <a href="http://shop.pimoroni.com/collections/kits/products/adafruit-pi-t-cobbler-breakout-kit-for-raspberry-pi">Adafruit Pi T-Cobbler</a>. It's a simple breakout board for the Pi with no actual electronics. I've been doing so much connect/disconnect stuff on the RPi pins recently I was sure I'd short something out eventually. This just makes things a little easier and has all the pins labelled. Took about 5 minutes to solder it together.

The other thing I got recently was <a href="http://www.7dayshop.com/7dayshop-wireless-air-mouse-keyboard-with-gyroscope-2-4ghz-1">a cheapish air mouse</a> from 7DayShop. This was actually more intended for XBMC/Raspbmc usage but I've realised it's perfect for travel. I was happily able to use it as a mouse and keyboard for X-Windows when checking out Google Coder recently. The particular one I got has overly-small arrow keys but that's really the only criticism I can make.

The only things I'm missing now are some raspberry coloured cables.
