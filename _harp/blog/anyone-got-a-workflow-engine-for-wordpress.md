#"Anyone got a workflow engine for Wordpress?"


    I&#39;ve been making my own little client sign-up workflow inside Wordpress but there is a definite opportunity for someone to build a mini-workflow-engine for WP.<p /><div>Just pages/forms with strong conditional logic and branching and go-back. My kludge with a long page hierarchy, smart url naming and Gravity Forms will do in the short term but I could really do with the branching to separate pages based on input to forms (e.g. different billing selections). And not having to worry about url changes breaking the flow.<p /><div>So basically Documentum for (almost)free, re-written in PHP and in a couple of megs. Takers? C&#39;monnnnnnn.</div><p /><p /><p /></div>
