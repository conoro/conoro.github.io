#"Ulster Bank now using Visa Debit Cards instead of Laser. Cheaper Ryanair?"


    I just got my new ATM card in the post from Ulster Bank and it&#39;s no longer a Laser Card, it&#39;s Visa Debit. They claim it is accepted in more places globally. This seems reasonable since I have never seen Laser as an online payment method outside of Ireland. <p /><div>One trick a lot of people have been using (the guys in <a href="http://www.curiouswines.ie/">Curious Wines</a> told me about it) when buying Ryanair tickets is to use an <a href="http://www.entropay.com/">Entropay</a> Virtual Debit Card. Ryanair doesn&#39;t charge a fee if you use a debit card but they won&#39;t accept Visa. Entropay only made sense if you had managed to get a sub-10 ticket since their own fees would then exceed those of Ryanair.</div> <p /><div>So the question is, can we now use the Ulster Bank Visa Debit on Ryanair and avoid their card fees?</div><p /><div>Damn, maybe not, the Ryanair site is saying the zero-fee thing is for Mastercard only and for a &quot;limited time only&quot;.</div>
