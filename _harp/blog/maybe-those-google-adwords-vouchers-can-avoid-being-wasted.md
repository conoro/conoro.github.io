#"Maybe those Google AdWords Vouchers can avoid being wasted"


 Yes it&#39;s that regular arrival in the post of a Google AdWords voucher that I can&#39;t use because we already have an AdWords account. Now they are offering 75 and it&#39;s a nice plastic card. I&#39;d love to know how much money is spent on this vs the resulting new revenue. Possible alternatives I can think of are: <ol><li>Send them to every startup incubation centre in Irelandto hand out to start-ups</li><li>Send them to Enterprise Ireland to hand out to start-ups</li><li>Send them to the County Enterprise Boardsto hand out to start-ups</li> <li>Send them to every tech course in colleges around the country to give to students</li><li>Send them to every OpenCoffee in Ireland</li><li>Send them to every Chamber of Commerce</li><li>Sponsor a BarCamp and send a few hundred of them down</li> <li>Sponsor a BizCamp and send a few hundred of them down</li></ol><div>Any other ones you can think of?</div>
