#"Honestly, this World Cup TweetDeck Filter is so good, I will never see this post"


    After much feedback from people and some cunningly slipped-through tweets, this filter seems to be 100% solid for removing every Tweet, Facebook update, Buzz buzzinga, Foursquare update and LinkedIn update on TweetDeck.
