#"Separated at birth - Philips VR512 and XBOX One?"

The VR512 cost me around 399 in 1992 in the Philips employee sale. A staggeringly good top-of-the-range VCR that did sterling service for over a decade.

The XBOX One is a mid-range PC with a small hard disk and VR512 inspired case. Oh but it has Skype. Like every PC since 2003.
