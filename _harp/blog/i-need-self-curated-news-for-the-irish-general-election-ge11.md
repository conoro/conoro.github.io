#"I need self-curated news for the Irish General Election #ge11"


 So I&#39;m lashing together a quick <a href="http://twitter.com/conoro/general-election-2011-10">General Election list</a> on Twitter for my Dad to follow. He&#39;s not on Twitter but he loves politics and I think he&#39;d get a kick out of it. I started with some of the obvious MSM accounts and then some people<i></i>I know who are interested in politics. Then I looked at some of their lists. I&#39;ve put a simple one together that I think he&#39;ll like. It&#39;s nowhere near finished yet but it&#39;s a start. <p /><div>Except of course it has a huge problem. It shows everything those people are tweeting. Every inanity, every irrelevant detail. What I need is the intersection of that list and the <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23ge11">#ge11 hashtag</a>. There is no way I wouldrecommendhe follows the hashtag if he wants to keep his sanity. 50,000 people all bitching about the same thing at the same time is not interesting to anyone.</div> <p /><div>So does such a webapp or desktop app exist? If not, why not? It&#39;s another Twitter app I would pay for.</div><p /><div>And if it could pull in Wall updates from Facebook Pages of politicians etc, that would be worth even more!</div> <p /><div>Am I the only one on Twitter who needs these kind of tools (like all my Filter requests) or is the perception that the money lies elsewhere?</div>
