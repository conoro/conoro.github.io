#"Oi Nokia. I'm still waiting for my free Ovi Maps"


    <div>Or is it Oy Nokia? Or even Nokia Oy.</div>
<p />
<p>You announced free Turn by Turn Voice Navigation in Ovi Maps on Jan 21st for your newest phones but hilariously not for your "flagship" device cos it didn't have enough space on C:.&nbsp;</p>
<p />
<div>It's now March 30th and my N95-8GB still asks me for money if I want to use voice navigation.&nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>What's the hold up? If it's technical, all you have to do is make the navigation licence in the current Ovi Maps on N95-8GB cost &euro;0. Job done.<br />
<p />
<div>Get the finger out.</div>
