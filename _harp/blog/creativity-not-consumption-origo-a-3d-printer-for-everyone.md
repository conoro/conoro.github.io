<p>Hello, I am Origo. I am a 3D printer for ten year olds.</p>
<p>You can draw your very own things in <a href="http://www.3dtin.com/">3Dtin</a> and Ill build them for you in plastic.</p>
<p>Right now, I am just an idea. I will be as easy to use as an Xbox or Wii. Ill be as big as three Xbox 360s and as expensive as three Xbox 360s. I will sit on your desk and quietly build your ideas, drawings and dreams.</p></blockquote>
