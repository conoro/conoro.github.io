#"MIT App Inventor Open Beta Preview"

<blockquote>For the past two months, we have been conducting a closed test of the system for an increasing number of testers, and weve currently scaled to 5000 testers. Today, were taking the next step, and opening the MIT App Inventor service to everyone. All you will need is a Google ID for log-in (for example, a Gmail account).</blockquote>

Really happy for the MIT team, they've done a great job getting <a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/">App Inventor</a> moved whilst nailing a bunch of annoying bugs. It now works on Internet Explorer too, which was a major pain point for us in our kids' school.

If you want a gentle introduction to programming and mobile Apps, whether you are an adult or kid, I can't recommend <a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/">App Inventor</a> highly enough.
