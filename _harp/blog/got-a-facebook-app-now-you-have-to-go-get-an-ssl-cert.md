#"Got a Facebook App? Now you have to go get an SSL Cert."


    <p>I got very confused on Friday when our old App which displays reviews on a Facebook Page Tab just disappeared from all the Pages it is on. Then I realised that most of those Pages were only showing the default Facebook Tabs. Where the hell did all the others go? I assumed the old tab needed an upgrade but wasn't bothered as our new tab was ready.</p>
<p>Today I was deploying our new Tab and ran into exactly the same problem. Then I remembered seeing a new field when setting the app up called "Secure Canvas URL". And suddenly the reason dawned on me.</p>
<p>I had turned on https as my default access method for Facebook earlier in the week. It helps avoid a lot of the security issues people have run into. But if you do that, then every app you interact with on Facebook now has to be accessible via https too!&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if you have an App and you haven't turned on https access, do so now, or watch your usage stats fall off a cliff over the coming months.</p>
<p>And if you are a user wondering where the hell your favourite apps have disappeared to, now you know.</p>
<p>Off to GoDaddy I go to get another cert.</p>
