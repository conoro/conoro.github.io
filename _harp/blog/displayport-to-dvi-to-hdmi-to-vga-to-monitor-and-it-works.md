#"DisplayPort to DVI to HDMI to VGA to Monitor - And it works"

Yesterday I got caught out in a meeting by having an MBP and a DVI adapter whilst the customer had a VGA projector. Luckily someone else saved the day with a proper Windows laptop with a VGA port :-)

For giggles I just tried daisy-chaining a bunch of adapters I've collected from various Chinese sources over the last two years. It works. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHVjs4aobqs">Inconceivable</a>! That's $29 fewer dollars in Apple's cofffers.
