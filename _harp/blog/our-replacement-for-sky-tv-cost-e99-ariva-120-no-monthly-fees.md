#"Our replacement for Sky TV cost \u008099. Ariva 120. No monthly fees!"


    So the kids complained about the removal of Sky. A lot. There are only so many Charlie and Lola episodes you can watch on YouTube, particularly the ones in Finnish. <p /><div>The intention was to get that very highly recommended Humax Freesat box on Amazon but it&#39;s bloody pricey and we weren&#39;t sure we needed all of the features. Then the very kind <a href="http://twitter.com/gpelly">@gpelly</a> on Twitter mentioned the hugely impressive Ferguson Ariva 120 Combo. I love finding absolute bargains that don&#39;t disappoint and this ticks both of those boxes. It is a FTA satellite receiver and DTT receiver. So it can handle Freesat and Saorview programmes. At 99 on <a href="https://www.satellite.ie/acatalog/HD_Ariva_120_Combo_Box.html#aFerguson120Combo">Satellite.ie</a>, it&#39;s a complete steal.</div> <p /><div>Ours arrived yesterday and already the kids are happier. I plugged a spare 500GB USB HDD into it and it does full PVR functionality too. You can watch DTT and record Satellite or vice-versa. It does 720p and 1080i and can upscale SD content. It has a LAN port, SCART and HDMI. I&#39;m intrigued by the LAN port. If they could add UPNP or SMB browsing then you have a pretty bloody decent streaming media player thrown in too. It&#39;s also tiny. Software upgrade is easily done using USB.</div> <p /><div>There is a <a href="http://www.boards.ie/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=2056284276">massivethread about it on boards.ie</a> with tons of support from Tony in Satellite.ie.</div><p /><div>The <a href="http://www.freesat.co.uk/">Freesat programme list</a> is not massive but is not bad. As it&#39;s not an official Freesat box, there is no EPG, so you only have now/next for the programme info. CBBC, CBeebies, CITV and daytime TV on some of the other channels should keep the kids from going completely mad.</div> <p /><div>I can&#39;t report on DTT performance as our aerial doesn&#39;t seem to be working right now. It is pointing into a tree in the general direction of the old Carrigaline repeater so I&#39;ll need to twist it to point to a local digital mast and test it too.</div> <p /><div>And all without any Rupert tax to pay. I&#39;m already thinking of getting a second one.</div>
