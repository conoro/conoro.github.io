#"The Condom Train Returns"


    <p>After some more reading on the lack of Paid Apps in Ireland, it appears that all the blame may not be on Google after all. From what I can see, Mobile Operators in each country have to sign up to the Open Handset Alliance (OHA) to get "access" to the Android Market.</p>
<p>How much do you bet that none of the Irish operators have done so?</p>
<p>We know that Three UK SIMs work in Vodafone Ireland HTC Desires. I'm pretty confident that they'll work in all other Irish Android handsets since the operators are just box-shifting rather than getting custom versions done.</p>
<p>Those Three SIMs are free.</p>
<p>In the 1970s, there were a series of famous train journeys to the North where motivated modern people went to buy tons of condoms and distribute them down South where they were banned by the local yokels.</p>
<p>So let's organise a follow-up.</p>
<p>Swarms of desperate Android owners and their friends grabbing fistfuls of free 3UK SIMs in Belfast and Newry, bringing them back over the border and distributing them to the hungry-for-apps hordes?</p>
<p>You know it makes sense.</p>
<p>"What do we want?" "Paid Apps" "When do we want them?" "Now!"</p>
<p>The revolution is upon us.</p>
