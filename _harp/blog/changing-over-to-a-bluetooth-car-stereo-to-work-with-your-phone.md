#"Changing over to a Bluetooth car stereo to work with your phone"

I blogged about this before ages ago but had some recent questions on it so I thought I'd do a quick update. If, like me, you drive an old car, your car stereo probably doesn't have an audio jack and almost definitely doesn't have bluetooth.

If you have a Ford from 1999 onwards then you have the added problem of a double height stereo whose CD player is probably knackered at this stage.

It turns out to be quite easy to replace any of the above with a dirt cheap stereo from Lidl or Aldi which gives you A2DP high-quality bluetooth audio through your car speakers when you pair your smartphone to it. As an added bonus you get an acceptable hands-free system built in too.

The steps are as follows:
<ol>
	<li>Buy one of the bluetooth units from Aldi or Lidl. I see <a href="http://www.lidl.ie/cps/rde/xchg/SID-2D79591D-3B4CF92F/lidl_ri_ie/hs.xsl/index_17063.htm">Lidl has one of them for sale</a> this Monday.</li>
	<li>Find your car stereo extraction keys or, if you can't, find 4 thin screwdrivers (jewellers ones work on many cars)</li>
	<li>You'll need two or threeadapters</li>
<ol>
	<li>The ISO audio/power one. e.g. <a href="http://www.incarexpress.co.uk/view_product.php?partno=PC2044">This one works</a> for Opel Astra</li>
	<li>The antenna one. e.g. <a href="http://www.incarexpress.co.uk/view_product.php?partno=PC5100&amp;gclid=CMm0me6x46..">This one works</a> for lots of cars</li>
	<li>Potentially a fascia blank-plate if you have a double-height Ford stereo. e.g. <a href="http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Ford-Focus-Fascia-Facia-Panel-Adapter-Plate-Surround-/250595006485?pt=UK_CarsParts_Vehicles_CarParts_SM&amp;hash=item3a58a05815#ht_2340wt_1139">this one for Ford Focus on eBay</a> (many sellers)</li>
</ol>
	<li>Pop the stereo out of the dashboard using the keys or screwdrivers</li>
	<li>Disconnect the cables at the back making sure none of them fall down into the bowels of the car</li>
	<li>Potentially remove the flimsy metal cage that held the stereo in if it was a third party brand e.g. the old Blaupunkt in my wife's Zafira</li>
	<li>Insert the fascia blank-plate if you have a Ford</li>
	<li>Connect power/audio to the new stereo etc using the ISO adapter</li>
	<li>Connect the antenna to the new stereo using its adapter</li>
	<li>Wiggle it all in. This can take a while. Mondeo as a doddle, Zafira was a horror</li>
	<li>Done!</li>
</ol>
Now you can pair your phone with the stereo and play all your music/podcasts.

Only word of warning is that the radio reception on our two Lidl/Aldi ones is rubbish in West Cork compared to the factory-fitted models.
