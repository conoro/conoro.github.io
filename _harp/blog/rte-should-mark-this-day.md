#"RTE should mark this day"


    I know I know, I do the early adopter crap all the time. &quot;Broadcast TV is dead&quot;, &quot;Shows will all be single-purchase via IPTV in 2 years&quot; &quot;I don&#39;t even know who presents the News on RTE now&quot; &quot;Late Late What?&quot;.<p /><div>But the average punter is still tuning in and watching the same old stuff, maybe a bit time-delayed by Sky+, but that&#39;s it.</div><p /><div>So, as always, we have to look at what the kids are doing to see what&#39;s really coming next.</div> <p /><div>Last night I realised that the day has come where <i>Early Adopter Mindset = Irish Tween Mindset</i> and all my predictions are now going to start hitting the mainstream soon.</div><p /><div> Why?</div><p /><div>Because my 11 year old son said &quot;Yeah, I saw that on the RTE Channel...........on YouTube&quot;.</div><p /><div>I&#39;m pretty sure he doesn&#39;t know what RTE actually is.</div> <p /><div>The end is nigh.</div><p /><div>Oh, and the Boxee Box will be <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/D-Link-Boxee-Digital-Media-Player/dp/B0043EV3MS/">available to buy</a> on Monday :-)</div>
