#"Mini Maker Faire in Dublin, Saturday 14th July, Science Gallery"

After reading tons of posts and watching lots of videos of the most recent <a href="http://blog.makezine.com/2012/06/28/best-of-maker-faire-bay-area-beats-bikes-robots-outdoors-and-arts/">Maker Faire in San Mateo</a> in the US, I wondered if anyone had ever organised one here. So I was more than a little happy to see there is a <a href="http://www.makerfairedublin.com/">mini-one happening in Dublin</a> in 3 weeks time. If you don't know what a Maker Faire is, watch this:

I might see you there. Some day I need to get to one in the US.
