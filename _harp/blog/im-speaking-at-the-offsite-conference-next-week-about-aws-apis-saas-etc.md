#"I'm speaking at the OFFSITE Conference next week about AWS, APIs, SaaS etc"

I mentioned the <a href="http://offsite.ie/event-agenda/">OFFSITE Conference</a> over on <a href="http://www.web2ireland.org/2012/09/03/west-corks-first-major-tech-conference-offsite/">Web2Ireland</a> recently. It's the frst time a major technology event is being held in West Cork and everyone in business in Munster and beyond should consider attending. It's all happening next week, 27th September in Rosscarbery.

<a href="http://offsite.ie/event-agenda/"><img class="size-medium wp-image-856 aligncenter" title="header-bg" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/header-bg-300x60.png" alt="" width="300" height="60" /></a>

The title of my talk is "<em>Building on The Shoulders of Giants: How Irish businesses can quickly deliver Enterprise-quality products through the smart use of software services</em>"

The bulk of the talk will be about all the lessons we have learned over the past few years in running the <a href="http://www.loudervoice.com/">LouderVoice</a> service on a cloud infrastructure and how you could do similar.

Some of the topics I'll be covering include:
<ul>
	<li>Building a SaaS business</li>
	<li>Amazon Web Services (EC2, EBS, EIP, RDS, S3, CloudFront, CloudWatch)</li>
	<li>IaaS vs PaaS (AWS vs Google vs Cloud Foundry vs Azure etc)</li>
	<li>Tying it all together with APIs</li>
	<li>Scaling</li>
	<li>Pricing and Cost Monitoring</li>
	<li>Robustness Cost-Benefit</li>
	<li>Pitfalls</li>
	<li>What's Next?</li>
	<li>Big Data Opportunities</li>
	<li>Open Data Opportunities</li>
</ul>
This won't be a geek-out session, it will be a business-centric talk where I hope those who are looking at the cloud get a lot of useful tips and cautions.

Let me know if there is anything in particular you would like to hear about.
