A few minutes ago, Google shut down Jaiku, just after I posted a #goodbye.

My last proper post there was 3 years and 5 months ago. For a short period in 2007, many thought it would overtake Twitter during the relentless fail-whale era, but it never got the traction.

I always said everything could have been different if Google had made it the Social Address Book in Android back in 2008. But siloed-thinking couldn't join the dots.

My full archive is now over on <a href="http://conoro.jaikuarchive.com">Jaiku Archive</a>.

It's too late to run any of the other backup scripts.

We should probably be as angry about Google not archiving this properly, as we were with Yahoo and Geocities, but obviously the scale is minuscule by comparison. And some of us have that archive above.

But do remember, what happened to Geocities and Jaiku could happen to Twitter or Facebook in 2015. So please make sure to install <a href="http://thinkupapp.com/">ThinkUp</a> somewhere so you can backup and own your own content.
