<p>I have long complained about the fact that Google Apps Accounts can&#39;t do the same things as normal Google Accounts. The problem was exacerbated by Google allowing people to create half-assed Google Accounts with the same email address as their Google Apps account but which were in fact completely different. </p><p /><div>Google is rightly now trying to clean this mess up and I don&#39;t envy them but gawd it&#39;s a complete pain in the arse.</div><p /><div>So we transitioned all of the LouderVoice accounts over the other day. Except we actually didn&#39;t because my non-Google-Apps but Google-Account <a href="http://loudervoice.com">loudervoice.com</a> email is hooked to an AdWords and AdSense account and they haven&#39;t been transitioned yet. So that&#39;s Pain 1.</div> <p /><div>Pain 2 - Everyone else is completely freaked out by the message they get from Google about killing theirnon-Google-Apps but Google-Account <a href="http://loudervoice.com">loudervoice.com</a> emails and replacing them with <a href="mailto:blah@gmail.com">blah@gmail.com</a>. Not only that but GMail on the iPhone gets completely confused by all of this messing and you end up in a logout-login cycle which eventually sorts itself out.</div> <p /><div>Pain 3 - Google Docs is having a really hard time. It&#39;s letting me access some files but not others. Even worse, it is transient, so re-trying seems to work. See the attached pic for a doc that <b>I </b>created!</div> <p /><div>It&#39;s going to be a horrible few weeks for Google Apps Account holders but hopefully when the dust settles, all will be well.</div>
