    <p>There are many great tech journalists out there but only one has stuck in my head from the early 1980s to today and that is Guy Kewney.
</p><p>I devoured tech magazines all through my teens and 20s and had stacks of PCWs filling up my presses and then my attic. From that entire period, Guy was the guy. He always felt like the ultimate kindly British boffin. A style of person I will always admire.
</p><p>A lovely piece in The Register from John Lettice with a mention of the legendary Elan Enterprise which I would gladly have sawn my arm off to get. The ultimate vapourware.
</p><p>Guy Kewney, RIP.</p></div>
