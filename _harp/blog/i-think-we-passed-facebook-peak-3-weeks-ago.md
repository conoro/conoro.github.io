#"I think we passed Facebook peak 3 weeks ago."

    I normally don&#39;t get overwrought about Facebook changes as they rarely affect me much. e.g. the Subscribe thing is a poor imitation of Twitter so I simply don&#39;t use it.<p /><div>But removing the option to show all stories chronologically?<p /><div><b>That&#39;s just not on!</b></div><div></div><div><div> I called Facebook peak at 21m users. Never one to learn from my mistakes, I&#39;m calling it again at 750m users, or whatever they were are at three weeks ago. <p /></div></div></div><div>Also, whilst I&#39;m at it, they should buy Turntable.fm and forget all those other music things they are announcing tomorrow.</div><p /><div>And Boxee.</div><p /> <div>And Hulu</div><p /><div>And make them all global and let us pay for shows using Facebook credits.</div><p /><div>Globally.</div>
