#"Facebook Like + Facebook Credits = Workable Micro-Payments?"


    <p>I was mulling this morning over the <a href="http://conoroneill.net/stephen-colbert-apologizes-to-all-of-ireland">silly post I did yesterday on Stephen Colbert</a>. In my ideal world, the TV show regional-licensing nonsense would go away and consumers in Europe would pay the US producers directly for each show (and vice versa for US consumers). If I want to watch Colbert right now, I want to flip 50c to the show's owners no matter where I am in the world. Then all of those clips can happily be shown worldwide without some middle-man trying to block them.</p>
<p>The problem with micro-payments has always been the "how". Without massive scale, people simply won't sign-up to the idea. And then it struck me. What if you had a Facebook Like tied to Facebook Credits? Something along these lines:</p>
<p><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>
<img alt="Like_credit" height="53" src="http://getfile9.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/temp-2011-06-06/JrgsuvszyAHaCAqDbCzzjksnBymAbdCceyrmbHwkbhlotpmJtsxBybpEyECB/like_credit.jpg.scaled500.jpg" width="176" />
</div>
Does that not convert millions of pages of content, videos and images into something monetizable? It removes all the friction of the PayPal Donate button, ties into the fact that you are all clicking Like constantly and makes you feel good because you are rewarding people for their efforts.</p>
