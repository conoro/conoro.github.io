<p>Today is the 20th anniversary of the web. Pretty incredible 20 years really. My own history of the internet was finding Usenet in 1990 when I started my Masters in UCD, followed by email, <a href="http://FTP.FUNET.FI">FTP.FUNET.FI</a>, Gopher, WAIS and the joy of downloadable shareware. There was then a pause from 92-94 as I worked on GSM basestation software in S3 and only had email. Ever resourceful, we then discovered FTP-by-email. Yes it was as clunky as it sounds but it bloody worked.</p>
<p />
<div>At the start of 1995 I was put in charge of an incredibly cool software project - to build the embedded software for Philip's first generation of MPEG-2 decoders. One of the requirements was to use a Real-Time Operating System (RTOS). Now this is proper Real-Time, not Twitter Real-Time. When you are decoding video, "best effort" is not good enough, you have no wiggle room when it comes to managing a transport stream with a 24Mhz CPU.</div>
<p />
<div>My boss at the time mentioned the Web, which I was vaguely aware of as a sort of tarted-up Gopher. He has Mosaic installed on his PC and a modem attached to that. The only access point in the entire company!&nbsp;He showed me some directory site (possibly Yahoo, but not sure) and I went digging. I also re-discovered Usenet and what a wonderful wealth of information it had. Actually I think you can call Usenet the Twitter of its day. It was the fastest most efficient way to get an answer to a technical question for years. Of course I can still <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.realtime/browse_thread/thread/45a79f6c41af58be/ef4f89bf18b35232?q=conor_o+m68k#ef4f89bf18b35232">search back on posts from 1995</a> thanks to Google. Try that in 2028 for this year's Tweets.</div>
<p />
<div>Somehow I found <a href="http://rtems.org/">RTEMS</a>, the&nbsp;<strong>Real-Time Executive for Missile Systems</strong>, renamed to the more palatable Real-Time Executive for Multiprocessor Systems. It was an OS developed for the US Army Missile Command in Alabama and was fully Open Source. It was also compatible with the Philips&nbsp;P90CE201&nbsp;variant of the 68000 embedded&nbsp;CPU we were using. I won't bore you with the details of compiling GCC cross-compilers on VAX but we had an <em>interesting </em>few months with RTEMS (and got a kick out of using a Missile OS in a Set Top Box). The attached screenshot from WaybackMachine from 1998 looks close to the one in 1995.</div>
<p />
<div>So in my mind the RTEMS site is the first real site I visited on the Web. Any idea what your's was?</div>
