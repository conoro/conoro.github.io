    <p>I'm thrilled to see YCYC come to Cork OpenCoffee and talk to the startup community in Cork. 
</p><p>Fantastic job by Gordon Murray in putting this together with everyone involved.
</p><p>I also think it's a great opportunity for everyone who has issues with and criticisms of YCYC to express them out in the open and have them addressed clearly by those involved in it. 
</p><p>I'll definitely be there and I hope to see all of you too.</p></div>
