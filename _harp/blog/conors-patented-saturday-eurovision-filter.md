And we made the final?<p /><div>Did any statues move?<div><br />To help fellow followers of the &quot;it ain&#39;t ironic, it&#39;s just shite&quot; school of thought. And also members of the &quot;I&#39;d rather die than re-live the 80s&quot; sect, here is the ultimate Tweetdeck filter for tonight.<p /> </div><div><div>&quot;eurovision, song contest, judge, judging, score, vote, song, sing, singing, ireland, niamh, niamh kavanagh, johnny logan, linda martin, twink, marty whelan, Azerbaijan, Spain, Norway, Moldova, Cyprus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Belgium, Serbia, Belarus, Ireland, Greece, United Kingdom, Georgia, Turkey, Albania, Iceland, Ukraine, France, Romania, Russia, Armenia, Germany, Portugal, Israel, Denmark, oslo, norway, fjords, reindeer, vikings&quot;</div> </div><p /></div>
