#"Google cancels Listen. I'm cancelling all non-core products by large corporations"

<blockquote>We launched Google Listen through Google Labs in August 2009, to give people a way to discover and listen to podcasts. However, with Google Play, people now have access to a wider variety of podcast apps, so <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.ie/2012/08/giving-you-better-google.html">weve discontinued Listen</a>.</blockquote>

I never thought Listen was very good but this cancellation is why more and more I avoid Google's non-core products. They are turning into Yahoo like this. I'm tired of putting effort into products by these large corporations, that only stand a tiny chance of being maintained.

From now on I'm sticking with products by tiny companies whose very survival depends on that product. So that's <a href="http://www.doggcatcher.com/">Doggcatcher</a> or <a href="http://www.beyondpod.com/Android/">BeyondPod</a> for podcasts.

It's another step in moving away from generic one-size-fits-all mass-production and towards custom products that are optimal for you.
