#"Rough n Ready Unboxing and Booting of Raspberry Pi"

Sorry, very busy, so zero production values in this video. Three snippets jammed together but I go from closed delivery packet to fully booted and operational <a href="http://raspberrypi.org">Raspberry Pi</a> with browser running in a few minutes.

Few immediate thoughts:
<ol>
	<li>Shockingly small. You don't realise just how small until it is in your hand</li>
	<li>It just works</li>
	<li>The CPU is fine but I think the 256MB RAM is going to be a problem fairly quickly. Most modern Linux apps expect more.Building Fuse from source took a bunch of tries as GCC ran out of memory until I found a low-memory setting</li>
	<li>It's slow but acceptably so</li>
	<li>It runs almost cold .Gotta love the ARM architecture.</li>
	<li>They should only highlight one Linux distribution on the site and put everyone's focus on that. Far too early for fragmentation or trying to please everyone.</li>
	<li>Should boot into XWindows by default and then show a "Welcome to RPi" screen like Linux Mint.</li>
	<li>The efforts on XBMC etc are very exciting</li>
	<li>Wireless keyboard and mouse saves you one USB port</li>
	<li>8GB Class 6 MicroSD in an adapter worked fine as the boot device</li>
	<li>Full-size SD cards for pennies on sites like 7DayShop</li>
	<li>It needs HW-accelerated GUI and decent Java support quickly</li>
	<li>I'd love to see someone put together RPi in a case with keyboard and mouse as cheaply as possible. In fact they should make it a competition. I have a $6 keyboard coming from HK at the mo.</li>
</ol>
Lots more stuff I want to try out at the weekend including making a nice case for it. Expect more posts from me in the coming weeks.
