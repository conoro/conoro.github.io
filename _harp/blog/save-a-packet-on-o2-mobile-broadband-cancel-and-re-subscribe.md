#"Save a packet on O2 Mobile broadband. Cancel and re-subscribe"


    I&#39;ve had O2 mobile broadband for something like 2 years. I haven&#39;t used it much at all in the past few months and cancelled it a few weeks back. It was costing 30 p.m. for 10GB. <p /><div>However the ongoing problems with Eircom DSL *every* *single* *night* from 7pm to midnight has been driving me insane. Throughput drops to almost 0bps. The feedback I see on Twitter is that I&#39;m not the only one and Cork seems to be particularly bad.</div> <p /><div>So I finally setup the big assed external antenna connected to a Huawei E176 dongle and all seemed ok on that front as a backup. But Vodafone mobile broadband in Bandon is brutal due to really minuscule backhaul.</div> <p /><div>Yesterday I trotted off down to the O2 Shop in Bandon to sign up again. Now I&#39;m getiing 15GB a month for 16.99 (normally 19.90). So my top Monday money saving tip - check your O2 bill. if you are giving them 30 a month for your dongle, cancel it.</div> <p /><div>Quick update on the external antenna. Yes it works in the attic, yes I get HSDPA but the throughput is very poor. So I&#39;m going to have to bite the bullet and mount it outside somewhere where previous tests showed good throughput.</div> <p /><div>Second quick update - the E176 works perfectly plugged into my Billion Router.</div>
