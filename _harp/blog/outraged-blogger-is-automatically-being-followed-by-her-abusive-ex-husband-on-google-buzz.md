    <p>I am now convinced no-one outside of Google ever tested this product before they went for global launch.
</p><p>I am also convinced that no-one inside Google had the balls to tell the people who built it that it was riddled with problems and was about as ready for release as Duke Nukem Forever.
</p><p>I don't think I've ever seen a webapp released with so many fundamental glaring flaws in all my life by a global company. This could easily be Google's own Bob.</p></div>
