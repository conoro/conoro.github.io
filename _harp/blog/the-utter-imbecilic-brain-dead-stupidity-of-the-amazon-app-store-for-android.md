#"The Utter Imbecilic Brain-dead Stupidity of the Amazon App Store for Android"


 <p><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;">We Irish Android early adopters railed against Google for their slowness in making paid Apps available outside of a tiny group of countries. Finally last year Google got their act together and we're all now good buddies again. No more 3UK SIM tricks for me (except for Flixster, strangely). </span></p>
<p />
<div>Amazon has just announced their own App Store for Android. Just what the world needs, another stripped down Android app store with fewer apps than the built-in one. Sure sure, if you bought an Archos tablet or slightly dodgy no-name (Sonly Ericcsun maybe) Chinese phone, you won't have the official market but 2 minutes Googling for a workaround usually sorts that out.&nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>But, ever the inquisitive, I downloaded and installed it. The offer of a free "Paid App" a day was a nice carrot. Of course I had to try the Angry Birds Rio App.</div>
<p />
<div>And then I got that message. That goddammed message we all thought we'd seen the back of. Not available in your goddammed region cos you're too goddammed small a country but we'll put our goddammed datacenters here because of the nice tax breaks, thanks very much.</div>

</div>
<div>Blah blah, country specific licensing, blah blah, copyright issues, blah blah blah. I wonder was that message actually delivered from a server sitting in Dublin? The ultimate insult.</div>
<p />
<div>Ye know Amazon, we're already dealing with this bullshit on your Android MP3 Store and on your Kindle Store, so you can take your Android App Store and stick it where the sun don't shine. If Google can figure it out with their legendary ability to negotiate with content providers (*cough*), surely you can.</div>
<p />
<div>If anyone is looking for Apps outside of the official Market, try <a href="http://appslib.com/">Appslib</a> or <a href="http://www.getjar.com/">GetJar</a>&nbsp;instead.</div>
