<p>You know me, I bitch about RTE all the time (I'm allowed, I'm a licence payer) but stuff like this makes me very very happy.</p>
<p>The PocketPlayer App has all the RTE Radio stations. My Dad was well impressed with it on his ZTE Blade. Tis far from listening to Irish dancing on his parents' tube radio in Rosbercon he has come in 72 years!</p>
<p>The Documentary On One App has a big archive of material.</p>
<p>I've used both of them and they are great but there is something very deep about the Documentary one and how it goes way back. Part of our history and culture in the palm of my hand, any time I want to listen.</p>
