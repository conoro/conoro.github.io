#"Just had a Horrible Thought. Could I move from Posterous to Google+?"


    I&#39;ve always loved the easiness of Posterous but it still has enormous problems with comments and Social Logins and I&#39;m getting really tired of it. The lack of an official Export feature (yes I know about the API) always worries me too. <p /><div>My default would be to switch to good old self-hosted WordPress plus something like Amplify for sharing interesting pages as posts.</div><p /><div>But I just had the scary thought that Google+ could be &quot;good enough&quot;. The Data Liberation Front means I don&#39;t have to worry about lock-in and the sharing features are pretty darned good. But of course all my old posts wouldremainstuck on Posterous and I can&#39;t have a custom domain.</div> <p /><div>Ah ok, maybe I&#39;ll stick with the WP idea.</div>
