<li>Grab <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/snapshots/">a nightly build</a> of the Chromium Browser</li>
<li>Install it</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/html5">Sign-up for HTML5 testing</a> on YouTube (thanks GammaGoblin!)</li>
<li>Go watch the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8EA7EbFX4k">Prince of Persia Trailer here</a> in that browser</li>
<li>If you see HTML5 and WebM in the footer of the video (as above), then you are watching a video in your browser without Flash and without the patent-riddled H.264</li>
<li>Click on 720p to get the best quality.</li>
<li> I can't see how to go full screen on it tho. Presumably that is coming soon.</li>
<li>It's all done using HTML5 and the VP8 codec that Google fully open-sourced last week</li>
<li>Mightn't mean much to you as a punter but as you can see, the quality is bloody good</li>
<li>The lack of patents or single-vendor lock-in is why HTML, http and other web standards were able to thrive and enable new businesses</li>
<li>The lack of a decent alternative to Flash as a delivery mechanism for video is why it thrived in the same period</li>
<li>Let's hope we see VP8 and the <a href="http://www.webmproject.org/users/">WebM project</a> enabling a whole new generation of video products and businesses.</li>
