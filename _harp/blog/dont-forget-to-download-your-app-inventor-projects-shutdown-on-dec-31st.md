#"Don't Forget to Download Your App Inventor Projects - Shutdown on Dec 31st"


    If you ever did anything on Google<a href="http://www.appinventorbeta.com">App Inventor</a>, you have 9 days to download your code.<p /><div>I had to log in 30 times to download all the projects of the kids in our school (30 teams of 2). Next step is to setup a private instance of App Inventor on App Engine and EC2 in lieu of MIT being ready. </div>
