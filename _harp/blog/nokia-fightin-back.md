    <p>I thought the N810 was the final nail in the coffin of Maemo since there was no senior management support for it. So I was thrilled they released the N900.
</p><p>Now everyone knows that high-end Nokia Smartphones will all eventually be Maemo even if Nokia can't admit it yet.
</p><p>Meego is a really smart move. A genuine fully-open competitor to Android that runs on a wide range of devices with two giants behind it.
</p><p>Nokia is back baby.</p></div>
