#"Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare, Gowalla and Latitude"


 The latest version of Google Maps has some upgrades to Latitude, the service no-one has ever heard of, or uses. The main new feature is &quot;Suggested Friends&quot; where it trawls your GMail and Google Apps accounts for people you know who are on Latitude. <p /><div>Prior to this I had all of 6 people I was connected to on Latitude.</div><p /><div>What did it come up with for me? Someone who has been using GMail for 5 years and has emailed thousands of people?</div> <p /><div>4 more.</div><p /><div>Let&#39;s compare to my connections on some of the other Location based services:</div><div><ul><li>Twitter - 628 (me following)</li><li>Facebook - 275 (Location being worked on right now, straight from the Zuck&#39;s mouth on Monday)</li> <li>Foursquare - 177</li><li>Gowalla - 46</li></ul><div>Even Gowalla, who I think needs to get an exit fast as they are becoming an also-ran, is way beyond where Latitude is at.</div><p /><div>Why Latitude even exists with the advent of Buzz I&#39;ll never understand.</div> <p /><div>Why Buzz hasn&#39;t been done properly on Maps I will equally never understand.</div><p /><div>Siloooooooooooooooo.</div></div><p /><div>LBS will be totally owned by Facebook as soon as they roll it out. Which gives Google maybe 6 months to get their act together with Buzz. Drop the Friendfeed-style nonsense, take the best bits of Maps, fully integrate Buzz there with Places and offers, job done.</div>
