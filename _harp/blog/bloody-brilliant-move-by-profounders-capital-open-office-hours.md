      <blockquote><div><p>Announcing PROfounders Open-Office Hours.&nbsp; Any startup, no agenda, 30 mins, no VC screening, lets chat. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We have been thinking about this for a long time, but we need to thank Mike Butcher (<a href="http://bit.ly/a5dnKh">http://bit.ly/a5dnKh</a>) for the nudge. &nbsp;We are happy to announce PROfounders Capital Open-Office Hours.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a first test, we have set aside three hours on Thursday June 10<sup>th</sup> and three hours on Thursday July 8<sup>th</sup> for Open-Office Hours. &nbsp;That will be a total of 24 slots for any startup company to come it.&nbsp; First come, first serve on signups.</p>
<p>We are using BookingBug for anyone to sign up for the thirty-minute slots.</p>
<p>Book here: &nbsp;<a href="http://uk.bookingbug.com/home/11306">http://uk.bookingbug.com/home/11306</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The rules are very simple: startups only, 30 minute slots, and no agenda. &nbsp;We can talk about anything you want: fundraising, strategy, product, distribution, the weather, etc. &nbsp;However, we wont waste 10 minutes telling you about PROfounders (just read the website beforehand: <a href="http://www.profounderscapital.com" title="www.profounderscapital.com">www.profounderscapital.com</a>).</p>
<p>This should be fun!</p>

    <p>My kind of VC company.
