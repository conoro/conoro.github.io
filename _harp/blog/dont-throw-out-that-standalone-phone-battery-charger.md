#"Don't throw out that standalone phone battery charger"

An old hack I had forgotten about.

There is nothing more annoying about phones than upgrading them and finding that your battery is a different size and won't fit in your old charger, even tho the contacts line up. OK, there is one thing more annoying - owning a phone that doesn't let you take the battery out (*cough* iPhone).

So rather than put the old HTC Desire charger in the bin, I went at it with a Stanley knife and some Sugru. Pretty it ain't, but my HTC Sensation battery now fits perfectly.
