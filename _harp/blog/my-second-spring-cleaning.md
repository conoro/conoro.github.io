#"My Second Spring Cleaning"

Were living in a new kind of computing environment. Everyone has a device, sometimes multiple devices. Its been a long time since we have had this rate of changeit probably hasnt happened since the birth of personal computing 40 years ago.

To make the most of these opportunities, I need to focus  otherwise I spread myself too thin and lack impact. So today I'm announcing some more closures, bringing the total to 70 Google features or services closed since my spring cleaning began in 2011:
<ul>
	<li>I first used <strong>Google+</strong> in 2011 in an effort to make it easy for me to discover and keep tabs on my favorite topics. While the product has a loyal following, over the years, my usage has declined. So, on March 14th, 2013, I retired Google+. Users and developers interested in alternatives can find me on <a href="http://twitter.com/conoro">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/conoroneill">Facebook</a>, <a href="http://alpha.app.net/conor">App.Net</a>, <a href="https://github.com/conoro/">Github</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/people/bandon1/">Flickr</a>.</li>
