#"How could I forget the coolest Christmas Hoodie ever?"

I keep forgetting to blog this despite the fact that I wear it every day.

My mother-in-law got me a fantastic Christmas present in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/WildSideSports">Wild Side Sports</a> in Bandon.

It's a <a href="http://rusty.com/us/mens/Wired-Series/Wired-2011">Rusty Hoodie</a> with, wait for it, built-in machine-washable headphones!

There is a separate pocket for your phone/MP3-player and a headphone plug in there. It runs up to the in-ear headphones which are actually the toggles at the end of the hood draw-string.

Not only is it a brilliant product but I will also single-handedly make hoodies the most uncool thing any teenager can wear. You're welcome.
