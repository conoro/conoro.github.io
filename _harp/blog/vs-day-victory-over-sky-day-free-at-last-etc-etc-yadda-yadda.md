#"VS Day - Victory Over Sky Day. Free at last etc etc yadda yadda"


    After our ongoing argument over the telephone connection with Sky TV, they doubled the multi-room charge, so we cancelled the lot in early August.Today the cancellation finally kicked in.<p /><div>The kids are in shock. </div><p /><div>We had planned to get a Freesat box but we&#39;re actually going to play it by ear and get nothing for a while. Let&#39;s see how they survive on the few stations they can get in &quot;Other Channels&quot; on the Sky box, along with BBC iPlayer, Hulu and YouTube.</div> <p /><div>I would say RTE Player too, but we don&#39;t watch RTE in our house except for the odd food show once every six months.</div><p /><div>Biggest holes are probably going to be Wizards of Waverly Place and Hannah Montana.The younger ones will be happy enough with CBeebies (by whatever route).</div> <p /><div>I still want to get a HBO subscription. Some day the US TV stations will figure all of this internet stuff out and put Rupert out of business.</div><p /><div>I&#39;ll report back after a week or so.</div>
