#"What the inside of an \u008088 Android Tablet looks like"

My daughter's Eken T02 is still going strong after nearly a year but it still has the same two problems as ever. [a] the accuracy of the touch screen is awful and [b] it barely lasts 45mins on battery.

I don't think I can do anything about the first problem but I decided last week to sort out the second one. Particularly considering Scribblenauts is now fiiiiiiinally available on Android (currently requires a US VPN, Market Enabler, Amazon App Store and a US virtual credit card. Slick ;-p )

I popped it open quite easily by removing 4 screws and a few plastic tabs. It's surprisingly neat inside but has a really weird smell!

Obviously the batteries are garbage based on how long they last so I ordered <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/3-7V-3500mAh-lithium-Battery-Rechargeable-Polymer-Li-Po-For-Tablet-PC-B-3768112-/321105035375?ssPageName=ADME:L:OC:IE:3160">a replacement</a> on eBay. It's a "3500mAh" unit with the usual proviso that Chinese mAh tend to be a bit different from the mAh the rest of the world measures in. It's also the usual China story where they'll arrive at some indeterminate point in the next few weeks. Should only take a minute to swap them. Fingers crossed it sorts the problem out.

I'll let ye know how it goes.
