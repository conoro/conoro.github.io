A lovely film for Father's Day from Jane and the <a href="http://sugru.com/">Sugru team</a>. It was a real pleasure having Julian, John and Ben visit us in Bandon. 

Sibal will be delighted to see her Raspberry Pi Lego case getting a great look in.

Tomorrow we're doing more digging into Arduino with her, Oscar and maybe Oisn. First, the treadmill :-)
