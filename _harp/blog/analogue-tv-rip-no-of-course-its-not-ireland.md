 <blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">According to the Guardian, of 26.8 million TV homes in the UK, 23.8 already have digital via Freeview boxes, satellite and cable (figures from TV ratings body Barb). If, like me, you live in a region that has already seen the switchover, then you'll know that, for the most part, the operation has been a very smooth one (despite what the initial naysayers predicted).</blockquote>

</p><p>In 1998, in Integral Design, we had our first meeting with RTE about building a Digital Terrestrial TV (DTT) STB.
</p><p>It is now 2010.
</p><p>Not much more needs to be said really.</p></div>
