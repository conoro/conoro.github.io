#"My App Inventor post about our kids' school is now on the MIT site"

You have no idea how proud I am of this. The lovely people in <a href="http://cs4hs.com/">Google CS4HS</a>and MIT have put my blogpost about our experiences with App Inventor in a rural Irish school up <a href="http://appinventoredu.mit.edu/stories/after-school-app-inventor-ireland">on the MIT site</a>.

Now to tell all the kids in 5th and 6th class. They'll be chuffed.
