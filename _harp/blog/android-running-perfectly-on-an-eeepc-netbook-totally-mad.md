#"Android Running Perfectly on an EeePC Netbook. Totally Mad."


    <p>This just totally blew me away. I grabbed the ISO of <a href="http://www.android-x86.org/">Android X86</a>, "burned" it onto USB stick, booted it on an ancient 700Mhz EeepC 701 Surf and 5 minutes after the initial download, it was running. Almost flawlessly.</p>
<p>Only issues I've run into so far are Wifi giving a bit of grief (LAN fine) and some text entry playing silly buggers. There is also no Android Market but there are ways around that.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The amazing thing is the speed. The EeePC absolutely flies with Android and this is on a "Live USB", it should be even faster if I do a full SSD install. Also using a touchpad actually works fine and the lack of touchscreen doesn't feel odd. It really makes me wonder what the point of the Chromebook is.</p>

<p>So if you have an old Netbook on which Windows crawls and Linux is just not your cup of tea, try this out. YouTube, GMail, everything works fine. I think I'll be handing this old machine over to one of the younger kids as soon as I suss the Flash situation.</p>
