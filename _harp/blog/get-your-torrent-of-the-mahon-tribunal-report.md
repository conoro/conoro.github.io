#"Get your Torrent of the Mahon Tribunal Report"

Yes there are perfectly legal uses of Bittorrent. Like when the <a href="http://www.flood-tribunal.ie/asp/Reports.asp?objectid=310&amp;Mode=0&amp;RecordID=504">site hosting the Mahon Tribunal Report</a> melts down under the load and even the Irish Times struggles to serve it up.

If you download it via bittorrent, please seed for a while after completion to assist others. The more who seed, the faster it is for everyone. Thanks.
