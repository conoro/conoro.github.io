<p>So I started reading about the TIME Zuck story on Gawker, lost interest about aparagraphin (it&#39;s TIME FFS, my Dad stopped buying it in about 1987) and suddenly I spotted the GAP Ad with its Foursquare button. </p><p /><div>Totally brilliant. Effectively a Facebook Like button for a product that will give me 30% off when I show it on my phone in-store. This is where 4SQ can nail it. Now if only the local coffee shop in Bandon would join in, they already have people vying to be mayor.</div> <p /><div>And don&#39;t you dare say that sequins don&#39;t suit me.</div>
