#"The in-betweeners"


    <p>Like many people, my blogging activities have collapsed. A lot of that is due to work commitment but another large part of it is that I post most quick thoughts and ideas to Twitter or Facebbok.</p>
<p>The problem there is discoverability and conversation threads. Sure someone can find a tweet weeks later but they'll never be able to reply to it in an intelligible way.</p>
<p>But I still don't have time to do full blog posts.</p>
<p>So think of this as the iPad of my online presence. It's for stuff that is too long for Twitter/Facebook (and deserves longevity) but is too short for all my Wordpress blogs.</p>
<p>Like my first blogpost in 2001, this may be the last thing I write here for months :-)</p>
