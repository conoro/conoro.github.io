#"Yahoo Kills Maps and OpenSources Sled/Postmile"


    I gave up on Yahoo a long long time ago. The ultimate bungee VP company that came up with so many great products and ideas but followed through on almost none of them. I wouldn&#39;t touch any new Yahoo web-app with a long shitty stick because I know it&#39;ll be canned 12 months later. <p /><div>The death of Yahoo Maps, once the absolute industry leader, is a case study in how Yahoo screws up. Brilliant piece on it over on <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/09/02/yahoo-maps-api-so-long-old-friend">Programmable Web</a>.</div> <p /><div>But then, every once in a while, as with <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/">Pipes</a>, Yahoo makes me smile and remember how &quot;My Yahoo&quot;was my home page for most of the 90s. It happened again last night with the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/nodejs/browse_thread/thread/90dde0c7ce9681e4">Open Sourcing of Sled</a> (and the rename to <a href="https://github.com/hueniverse/postmile">Postmile</a>). You probably don&#39;t know Sled but I played around with it a bit over the summer. It was a very neat, very responsive, list-making tool. The reason I was trying it was that it was built using <a href="http://Node.js">Node.js</a> and our next project is doing the same.</div> <p /><div>The <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/nodejs/browse_thread/thread/90dde0c7ce9681e4">Google Groups post about it</a> highlights the fact that Yahoo is still doing interesting stuff and doing virtual startups/skunkworks. The Open Sourcing of it is important for the Node community as there are very few complete end-to-end meaty sample Node Apps out there using<span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">MongoDB, Express, Socket.IO, Jade, JS, HTML5 and OAuth that people can learn from. This will hopefully be a showcase for what&#39;s possible using the latest in web tech.</span></div> <div></div><div>Whilst I am thrilled with the project going up on <a href="https://github.com/hueniverse/postmile">GitHub</a>, the fact that they are killing it internally in Yahoo tells the same old story. What is the future for Yahoo?</div>
