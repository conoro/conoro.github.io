#"Quick update on Eken T02 Tablet and where is Scribblenauts for Android?"

I asked my 8 y/o daughter on Monday if there was anything she didn't like about her 88 Tablet after a week of ownership. I assumed she'd gripe about the touch sensitivity of the screen, which I still see as a problem. Nope, she had a single criticism - the battery only lasts a couple of hours on a charge. Otherwise she loves it. She streams TV shows and movies across the homenetwork, browses the web and plays lots of games. Exactly what you want in a tablet.

I'm holding out for a 7" one with slightly better CPU/GPU and an IPS screen. Should come in around the 110-130 mark. Maybe that Ainol Elf. I doubt I'll have to wait long.

As far as she is concerned, the only thing Android lacks is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scribblenauts">Scribblenauts</a>. Come on <a href="http://www.wbie.com/">5th Cell</a> and <a href="http://www.wbie.com/">WB Games</a>, get the finger out. Huge youth market for it, all moving away from NDS at the speed of light and not going to iOS.

I just checked out Sonic TheHedgehog4 Episode 1 on the Eken. However bad I thought Nintendo's future was looking before, this game confirmed that they are dead unless they bring out an Android gaming device in 2012.
