#"PAYG data effectively 4x more on 3IRL than 3UK......in Ireland"


    <p>I've mentioned my Pay As You Go Three UK SIM many times on Twitter. The value and customer friendliness of it is still unbeatable. Walk into a Three UK store, give them &pound;10 and get a SIM with a ton of minutes, texts and 150MB data that lasts 90 days.Top it up with another tenner for good measure and that doesn't expire.</p>
<p>If you use that SIM in Ireland (ROI), they text you to say that you get 10p per min call, free to receive, 10p per SMS and 10p/MB for data.</p>
<p>Now go to the Three Ireland site and look at their PAYG data deals. Oh that's right, you get no data included with your &euro;10 Free SIM. So how do you get data?</p>
<p>You can get 1GB per month add-on for &euro;9.99. Perhaps someone in 3 Ireland can explain how a per month charge = Pay As You Go?</p>
<p>Or I can get a mobile broadband deal. Because as we all know, data packets on your phone are entirely different to data packets on a broadband modem. Those deals are 1 day (500MB) at &euro;5, 1 week (2GB) at &euro;10 etc. On the surface, solid value. But no-one on PAYG needs 2GB in a week, they need less spread over a longer period. Otherwise they'll just take pay monthly contract.</p>
<p>So let's say you pay your &euro;5 for the one day. How much is data after that i.e. How much is it to Pay As I Go? 49c per MB. FOUR TIMES MORE than Three UK charges in Ireland.</p>
<p>FOUR TIMES MORE.</p>
<p>I had high hopes for Three being disruptive when they came to Ireland. The UK operation really is at the cutting edge of value for money and interesting services/devices. But obviously they saw that the Irish love nothing better than to be ripped off by mobile operators and figured they'd get a chunk of that action.</p>
<p>You'll find your friendly Three UK Store at "3 STORE, 48A - 49 Buttercrane Shopping Centre, Newry, BT35 8HJ"</p>
<p>Small warning tho. Don't use it to receive calls/texts in the South. The people contacting you will be gouged by their local Irish mobile operator.</p>
