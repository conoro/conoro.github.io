All the details over on <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/1545">their blog</a> and in <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Summer-Code-001c.pdf">this PDF</a>.

I'll always remember the months I spent building a data graphing application for the ZX Spectrum for a schools programming competition back in the 80s. You ain't seen a piechart until you've seen a Spectrum colour-clash pie-chart like that. Of course I didn't even get a mention, let alone win the thing. Bitter? Me? Never.

So pass this on to your kids. Given the damned weather, it's not like they can go outside anyway. I think I'll try and get our eldest to do the RPi part of our doorbell project.

If you don't have an RPi yet, you can use an emulator.
