<p>I connected up our Zoom Router and O2 Dongle to the cigarette lighter via an old DC inverter this morning in prep for our drive from Rosslare to Bandon.</p><p /><div>The idea was that Oisn and Oscar could connect to it using their phones and then stream their choices of songs from YouTube etc to the car stereo over A2DP Bluetooth for free. Unfortunately before we&#39;d even got out of Rosslare I detected the smell of burning. I touched the inverter and it was roasting hot. I quickly unplugged. Ah well, next time I won&#39;&#39;t use a cheap 4 year old one of eBay, I&#39;ll use the one I got in Lidl recently. <p /><div>On our last drive we could get 3G over large chunks of the N25. Add in some Google Music offline storage and buffering and we have a very usable solution.</div><p /><div>Actually, on the topic of power, any chance the car manufacturers of the world could agree a new socket standard for 12V that doesn&#39;t require you to re-seat the connections every day? The current cigarette light socket design vies with SCART as the worst physical standard ever invented.</div> <p /></div>
