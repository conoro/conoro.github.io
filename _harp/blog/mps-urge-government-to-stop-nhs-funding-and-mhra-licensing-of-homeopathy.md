#"MPs urge government to stop NHS funding, and MHRA licensing, of homeopathy"


    <div class="posterous_bookmarklet_entry">
      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><p>This was a challenging inquiry which provoked strong reactions. We were seeking to determine whether the Governments policies on homeopathy are evidence based on current evidence. They are not.</p>
<p>It sets an unfortunate precedent for the Department of Health to consider that the existence of a community which believes that homeopathy works is evidence enough to continue spending public money on it. This also sends out a confused message, and has potentially harmful consequences. We await the Governments response to our report with interest.</p></blockquote>

    <p>Nice to see the British have MPs with some cop-on. Great news for evidence-based medicine instead of voodoo.</p></div>
