#"EirePreneur:Mobhaile misgivings"

            <p>Bernie Goldbach shares some of my misgivings regarding <a href="http://irish.typepad.com/irisheyes/2004/05/open_note_to_br.html#more" title="IrishEyes: Open Note to Brian Skelly">Mobhaile,  the Local Government Computer Services Board's new public information initiative </a>. Most pertinently he asks -</p>

<blockquote>"What's wrong with rolling out an Irish-wide blogging system? The model has been tested since 1999 by several Irish bloggers. The back-ends are simple modifications of Perl, PHP, and scripted environments. There's no need to replicate document libraries or to deal with anything more complex than a MySQL database. The rabid uptake of this model across the world proves anecdotally and systematically how well-oiled and carefully grown micropublishing systems build effective communities.

<p>In the blogging world, affinity groups connect effortlessly. If the government provided the superstructure in the form of web hosting, occasional training, and cross-channel marketing, the results would work themselves. "</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Approaching my 2 year blogging anniversary I have to agree with these astute observations. I too attended the Mobhaile stand at last month's ICT Expo and saw very little that I imagined could not be easily replicated with the standard tools and services of the blogosphere.</p>
