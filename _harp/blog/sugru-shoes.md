#"Sugru Shoes"


    <p>My mum bought some very funny flamenco dresses for my two girls recently in Spain. Total spotty horrors but the girls loved them. She just topped that by getting them spotty flamenco shoes with big stomping wedge heels on them.</p>

<p>As they were bought in a local mini-mart in Torremolinos, the quality ain't great, to put it mildly. S&iacute;ofra popped the clasp rivet on hers within a couple of hours and left too big a hole to just pop it back in. I tried a few approaches but nothing worked so I gave Sugru a try. I knew it wouldn't be great as I only had blue sugru but I went ahead anyway.</p>
<p>Another result for the Kilkenny inventor, her Sugru worked perfectly!</p>

<p>I even went a step further and nicked some Airfix paint from her big sister's kit (blogpost on that soon) and painted it red. Not ideal but the 4 y/o is thrilled her shoes are back in action.&nbsp;</p>
