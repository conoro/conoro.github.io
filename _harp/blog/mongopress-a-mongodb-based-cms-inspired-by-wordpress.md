#"MongoPress - A MongoDB-based CMS inspired by WordPress"


    These guys started out building a plugin for WordPress to make it use MongoDB instead of MySQL but found it was almost impossible. So they decided to build an alternative called <a href="http://www.mongopress.org/">MongoPress</a> based on many of the good things about WordPress and hopefully none of the bad things (Die-WordPress-Editor-Die-Die-Die).<p /><div>It&#39;s early days but it looks interesting so far. I&#39;ll play around over Christmas and see how it scales. <p /><div><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/N37JulF8XTI?wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen frameborder="0" height="417" width="500"></iframe> </div><p /></div>
