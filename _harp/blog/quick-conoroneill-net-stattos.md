#"Quick conoroneill.net Stattos"


    <p>I've been blogging since 2001 and have long since lost any interest in stats on my blog posts. I never check non-biz related stats. But for interest's sake I've been monitoring conoroneill.net since it is a brand-new blog.</p>
<p>I dunno if these stats are good, bad or indifferent for a new blog that is 99% promoted via Twitter and Facebook links. The one that jumps out at me is that whilst Twitter generates 18% of the visits, Facebook only generates 4%. That's a reflection of the much smaller number of people I'm connected to on FB and their mainly non-tech demographic.</p>
<p>So according to Posterous since Feb 3rd 2010:</p>
<ul>
<li>102 Posts</li>
<li>2,220 site views</li>
<li>Most viewed post had 690 views (mainly cos <a href="http://mulley.net/">Damien</a> Fluffed it): <a href="http://conoroneill.net/how-do-you-get-your-irish-web-business-news">How do you get your Irish Web Business News</a></li>
<li>Second most viewed post had 656 views (ditto re the fluffing): <a href="http://conoroneill.net/huge-mistake-by-google-with-earth-on-android">Huge Mistake by Google with Earth on Android</a></li>
<li>Third most viewed post had 579 views (un-Fluffed): &nbsp;<a href="http://conoroneill.net/jolicloud-not-what-i-expected">JoliCloud not what I expected</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And according to Google Analytics from Feb 16th to Mar 18th:</p>
