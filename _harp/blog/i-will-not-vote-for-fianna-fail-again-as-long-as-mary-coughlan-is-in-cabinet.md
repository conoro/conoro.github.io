<p>Of course a lot of this particular story is Ryanair spin but Mary Couglan is simply not competent as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and is an active impediment to the economic recovery of this country.</p>
<p>She is not in possession of the background, knowledge, skills or aptitude to have this portfolio.</p>
<p>She leaves a trail of embarrassments, gaffes and diplomatic near-incidents every time she speaks in front of foreign companies or dignitaries.</p>
<p>Brian Cowen is putting personal friendship and political alliances before the good of the country.</p>
