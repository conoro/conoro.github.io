#"Makey Makey - You will soooooo Wanty Wanty"

In the middle of the Sparkfun video about Maker Faire, I learned about the <a href="http://www.makeymakey.com/">Makey Makey</a>. It's stuff like this that made me want to be an engineer as a kid. It's just fricking amazing (in my best attempt at a US accent). I'll be ordering one as soon as they are available.
