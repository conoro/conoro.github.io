<p>I pointed out yesterday that if you @ someone in Buzz, it posts their email address in the buzzinga, which is mind-boggingly stupid. Techcrunch has now run with a similar story.</p>
<p>But the important bit is the Google response. Read it and weep.</p>
<p>They actually think that people only have one email address! Hell even my technophobic Dad and Mother-in-law each have two, one from ISP and one from GMail.</p>
<p>And they have obviously never heard of their own product known as GoogleApps.</p>
<p>I now understand why there are so many fundamental implementation errors in Buzz.</p>
