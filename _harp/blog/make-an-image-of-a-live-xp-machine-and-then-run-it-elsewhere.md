#"Make an image of a live XP machine and then run it elsewhere"


    I blogged recently about the pain of upgrading a machine from XP to Win 7 due to the dreaded Sage. So I&#39;ve continued to hold off. But I just had a total brainwave for a potential solution and it looks like it is possible. <p /><div>I thought &quot;what if I could snapshot the XP install some way using VMWare or VirtualBox?&quot;. The idea is that I could do the snapshot, save it somewhere, do a clean install of Windows 7, install VMWare/VirtualBox and then run that image inside Win7 to do any Sage work.</div> <p /><div>Turns out those fine people in VMWare <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/converter/">are already miles ahead of me</a>. I still remember installing a pre-release version of VMWare back in 1999 and thinking &quot;this is gonna be huge&quot;. If only I&#39;d had money I&#39;d have bought stock. Funny to then be working in EMC when they bought them.</div> <p /><div>Anyway. I&#39;ll report back on whether it works for me or not. Obviously I&#39;ll try on another machine before zapping the source machine.</div>
