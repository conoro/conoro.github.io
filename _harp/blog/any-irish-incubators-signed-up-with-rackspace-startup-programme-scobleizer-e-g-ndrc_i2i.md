    <p>Looks like a fantastic deal from Rackspace. Pinged them but got no response yet.
</p><p>You'd think Amazon in Ireland would jump on the opportunity to support Irish start-ups in Incubators after the PR disaster of the recent outage but I've seen no supports from them apart from their global competition thing.
</p><p>I always feel that Rackspace has a very low profile in Europe compared to AWS. Could be a nice way to improve that (SeedCamp, iGap, etc).</p></div>
