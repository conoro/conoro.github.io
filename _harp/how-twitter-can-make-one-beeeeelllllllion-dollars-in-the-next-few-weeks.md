After 7 long years, Twitter finally added people muting recently. Meanwhile those of us who never use the official apps and use Janetter etc instead have had powerful keyword filtering for years. I see Twitter has some silly "which team do you support in the World Cup" nonsense now. But they really aren't thinking this through. There are many many many many people on Twitter who would happily never see a World Cup tweet. Why not make that happen as an opt-in but instead of just hiding them, replace each World Cup tweet with an Ad for something non-sport-related (in third party clients too). Finally a sustainable business model for Twitter. For the summer at least :-) You're welcome Twitter.
