<p>After talking about it a few times over the past few months, I finally decided to try working whilst standing today. The buzz around the idea on Twitter today presumably came from <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5735528/why-and-how-i-switched-to-a-standing-desk">Gina&#39;s post on Lifehacker</a>. Well worth a read. </p><p /><div>I am going for the environmentally friendly (aka zero cost) option of two cardboard boxes to implement my Standing Desk. Amazingly it is working really well and the boxes are at exactly the right level. The pressure on my wrists was immediately relieved. Hopefully the RSI in my right arm, which has left two of my fingers numb for six months, will finally ease.</div> <p /><div>It&#39;s a bit hard on the feet/legs but in a useful way since it forces me to move around on my feet as I type. I&#39;ve been standing for the past five hours or so and I don&#39;t feel any real need to sit down. I&#39;m even taking calls whilst standing. My guess is that my intermittent treadmill training is helping me here.</div> <p /><div>The only change I may make is to raise the monitor. Right now it is at the normal level but tilted up towards me.</div><p /><div>My only worry is that my gorgeous legs could be ruined by varicose veins. My career as a leg model could go up in smoke. I switched to lightweight Asics runners after lunch. Probably better for my feet.</div>
