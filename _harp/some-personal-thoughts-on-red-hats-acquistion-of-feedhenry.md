Here's a quick potted history of me and computers/languages/OSes to set the scene for talking about Red Hat.

* 1982-1986, Home: ZX Spectrum. Basic, Forth, Z80 Assembler. Loved it.
* 1986-1989, UCD Eng: Some mainframe yoke. Fortran. The horror, the horror.
* 1989-1989, Philips Eindhoven: Computervision Workstation. Cool.
* 1989-1990, UCD Eng: PC, DOS. Final year project. Happy days. C
* 1990-1992, UCD Eng Masters: PC Windows 3.0 and HP Apollo HPUX. Both fab.  C, C++. First experience of d'internet and shareware and compiling from source.
* 1992-1994, S3: Vax with VT-100. C. The horror the horror again. Finally got a PC with Windows.
* 1994-1995, S3: Sun Sparc. C. Oh this isn't bad even if Motif is an abomination. Remote X-Windows cool. Oh what's this Java thing?
* 1996-2000, Integral Design: PC Windows NT. Rock solid. 1/3 price of SUNs.
* 1996-1996, Integral Design: Slackware Linux. My first ever Linux install in Sunnyvale. Did not go well.
* 1997-2000, Integral Design: Red Hat Linux. Under my desk. Skunkworks :-) JUst got better and better.
* 2001-2006, Xilinx/EMC/McAfee: PC Windows.  C, C++, Java, Perl, Python. Nothing interesting to report.
* 2001-2006, Home: Red Hat, Fedora up to about FC 6. Playing, learning, configuring.
* 2006-2008, LouderVoice: CentOS
