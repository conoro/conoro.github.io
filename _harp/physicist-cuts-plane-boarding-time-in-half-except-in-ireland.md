#"Physicist cuts plane boarding time in half - Except in Ireland"


 <div class="posterous_bookmarklet_entry">
 <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><p>"This savings could be as much as $110,000,000 annually per carrier--well over a billion dollars for the industry--and likely could be more given the parallel nature of the boarding process," Steffen writes in a recent <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1108.5211">follow-up paper</a>. "Indeed, a test with a longer aircraft may show surprising results in this regard."

 <p>As anyone who travels regularly know, 97% of Irish people are genetically incapable of boarding a plane quickly, efficiently or correctly. 
</p><p>The best example of this that I encountered was on a recent Ryanair flight to Stansted. The person in front of me got on the plane via the rear door, decided to pick the second-last seat, spent several minutes dicking around in the aisle with their bags and finally turns around and asks "oh did you want to get past?".
</p><p>You also see people with no hand-baggage queuing for a plane with assigned seating, before the plane has even landed. 
</p><p>So whilst the Steffen Method looks wonderful, the only way it will work here is if cattle prods were involved. I would love to see Ryanair try this. The cattle prods I mean.</p></div>
