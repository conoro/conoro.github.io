#"Is Google Insane? Blocking Facebook Contacts Sync on Nexus S"


 That&#39;s an absolutely killer feature of Android. Blocking it shows just how scared they are of FB.<p /><div>Of course if they&#39;d listened to me and all the geeks on Jaiku back in the day before they launched Android......</div> <div>But then I&#39;m just repeating myself for the thousandth time.</div><p /><div>Luckily there is a strong Developer community on FB and a strong one on Android too. I expect a workaround for this within days, hours even.</div> <p /><div>As for claiming it&#39;s because &quot;you can&#39;t export your data&quot;. Bullcrap, if they had spent less time on things like Pubsubbubblydubblydubhub in Buzz, they might have ended up with a usable and useful product, not an open standards showcase that no-one uses.</div>
