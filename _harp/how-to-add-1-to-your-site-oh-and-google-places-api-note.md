<p>Shur it can't do any harm. Already adding to some of our sites. All we need now is Google's Graph API.</p>
<p>How does a site stand out when millions of other sites have the same feature? Just wondering.</p>
<p>BTW, the Google Places API is now open to everyone. Disappointed there is no Reviews API.</p>
<p>Which reminds me, the Places API when it was in Beta had the same outcome as every other attempt I have made to get access to a Google Beta API. I never got any response when I filled out yet another Google Doc Form That No-one in Google Ever Reads.</p>
<p>Why do they bother with those forms? Don't get me started on the /dev/null that is the Rich Snippets request form.</p>
