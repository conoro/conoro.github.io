#"Instant Google CloudOS Reaction"


 <p>On Monday night I grabbed an image of Google's not-yet-released CloudOS operating system, stuck it on a USB stick and booted my Acer Aspire One netbook with it. <p />In under10 seconds I had a login prompt. 5 seconds after that I was in and using it. Pretty shockingly impressive.<p /> It currently a very basic desktop with mainly links to web apps. Browser is obviously Chrome.<p />Very slow (since it is totally non-optimised for any hardware) but amazingly, video works, network works, decent resolution works. Only audio seemed to be a problem.<p /> Unlike certain other appliances, this will be the netbook OS your granny buys. Why? Cos she can print out her Ryanair boarding pass, she can Skype her grandkids, she can buy music on the Amazon store, download it and use it there and then. <p /> It looks about 6 months away from release and will need lots of sexy design to keep the form-over-function people happy but ye know, it feels just about right even now.</p>
