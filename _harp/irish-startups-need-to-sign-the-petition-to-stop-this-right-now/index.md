#"Irish Startups need to Sign the Petition to Stop This - Right Now!"


 <div class="posterous_bookmarklet_entry">
 <blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">Under the proposed Directive, VCs will be required to disclose a lot more information, which is likely to cost as much as 100,000 annually per investee company. The Directive also imposes much greater capital requirements on venture firms, even as funds are shrinking to reflect the ease of creating startups now. VCs will also have to use outside depositaries (i.e. custodians) and independent valuation agents, again, adding cost and complexity.</blockquote>
