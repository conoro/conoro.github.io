#"Interesting way to order \"impossible\" things from abroad"


 <p>I spotted this on one of the Android forums earlier. It's a way of ordering things from abroad from vendors who won't ship outside of their own country. I've heard of similar in the US for years but I didn't know it was here in Europe too.</p>
<p>The service is called <a href="https://www.borderlinx.com/m/pages/eu/how-it-works">Borderlinx</a> and appears to be facilitated by DHL. So you order something from the UK and give the Borderlinx UK address for delivery. Once Borderlinx gets it, you tell them where you really want it shipped to and when. The example I read was ordering a mobile phone in one country from Orange in the UK. Normally impossible but supposedly it works with Borderlinx.</p>
<p>Anyone use them? Thoughts? Good value?&nbsp;</p>
<p>One potential problem I see is that many sites will only deliver to the address associated with your credit card.</p>
