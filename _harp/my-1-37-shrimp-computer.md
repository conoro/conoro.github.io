#"My \u00a31.37 Shrimp Computer"

I heard about the <a href="http://shrimping.it">Shrimping It</a> project a few months ago and loved it immediately. Based in Morecambe in the UK (hence the name), it's an initiative to get Arduino compatible boards in the hands of anyone for less than 2.

I couldn't resist and ordered the necessary ATMega chip plus Xtal from <a href="http://ie.farnell.com/">Farnell in Ireland</a> along with the usual cheapo bits from <a href="http://dx.com">DX</a> in China.

You also need to splash out on a <a href="http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/USB-to-UART-TTL-6PIN-Module-Converter-buildin-in-CP2102-/250893154137?pt=UK_BOI_Electrical_Components_Supplies_ET&amp;hash=item3a6a65b759">CP2102 programmer</a> on eBay. Mine cost 2.08.

Last night I soldered the whole thing up, and amazingly for me, it worked first time. I added some headers to make connecting simpler and ran the <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/blink">Arduino LED Blink</a> example on it.

I'll be using this one for the next i-racer remote control that I build.

If you are interested in playing around with electronics or teaching your kids about it, I can't think of a better way to spend a fiver.
