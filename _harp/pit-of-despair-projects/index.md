#"Pit of Despair Projects"

I have a bunch of blogposts bouncing around in my head which I'll hopefully start writing on my holliers, from Friday. Stuff around the tactile nature of hardware, Makers, having a Masters in Electronics I never really used, low volume production, crowd-sourcing solutions to problems instead of relying on guv'ment, moving production back to the first world, education, Kickstarter, doing vs learning etc etc etc.

There are a ton of companies supplying the Maker market and electronics people in general. Two of my favourite are <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com">Sparkfun</a> and <a href="http://www.adafruit.com">Adafruit</a>. I just watched this video by the CEO of Sparkfun and I like them even more now. He has concerns about every project going into Kickstarter and why other models may be moreappropriatein many cases.
