#"Clay Shirky on Git, diffs and Government legislation"

The reason I like Clay Shirky's talks so much is because he communicates complex "stuff" in a way most people can understand. 

Here he ties together Git, diffs and Government legislation beautifully. If you are similar with the law but not Git or diffs, it's well worth a watch. And vice versa.
