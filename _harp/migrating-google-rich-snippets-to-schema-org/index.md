 <p>Shakes fist at one of his tech heroes but shouldn't be too hard to change TBH. 
</p><p>One question: If Google is already showing your Rich-Snippet Reviews based on hreview with stars in the SERPs, will moving to microdata markup drop you off the SERPs again and force you to re-apply yet again on their ridiculous non-web-scale Google Docs Form?
