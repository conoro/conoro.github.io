I generated this list a few months ago for [Clonakilty Coder Dojo](http://coderdojowestcork.wordpress.com/) after demoing a pile of my projects/gadgets to them. Can't believe I'm only blogging it now. Hope you find it useful.

## Learning about Arduino
* Adafruit has a ton of stuff on [their learing site](http://learn.adafruit.com/category/learn-arduino)
* MAKE Magazine is amazing. [Get a subscription](http://makezine.com/)
* Watch the Sparkfun [Friday New Products Videos](https://www.sparkfun.com/news/1141) 
* Watch the [Ben Heck Show](http://revision3.com/tbhs) every week
* [Hack a Day](http://hackaday.com/) is very hardcore but amazing to see how hackers think.

## Making Arduino and Raspberry Pi work together
Gert van Loo who did the original design for the Raspberry Pi now has an [RPi board called the GertDuino](http://www.element14.com/community/docs/DOC-64326) that contains an Arduino and can use Arduino add-on shields. It seems like the best of both worlds and I'll be getting one for myself.

## Learning about Raspberry Pi
* [Adafruit again](http://learn.adafruit.com/category/raspberry-pi)
* [The MagPi Magazine](http://www.themagpi.com/) (a bit too techy)
* [Recantha](http://www.recantha.co.uk/blog/)- Michael mainly links to other sites but it's a great way to see what's happening out there.
* The [Raspberry Pi blog](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) itself

## Raspberry Pi Minimum setup
Raspberry Pi + 4GB SD Card (Class 10) + 1.1 Amp Phone Charger + HDMI cable + Wireless KB/Mouse + Wifi Dongle
It can work with old TVs on SCART cable but picture is very fuzzy.


## Very cheap Chinese Electronics including Arduino clones
The main site is [DX.COM](http://dx.com/) - They have tons of stuff. Very cheap. No postage charges but takes a minimum of 3 weeks (usually more) for things to arrive. Make sure to keep orders less than approx €50 to avoid import duties. Just split large orders up. Assume that if things break, you'll either repair or bin them. Doing returns to China is a disaster.

[Elecfreaks](http://www.elecfreaks.com/) in China is also very good.

* [RC Car]() <a href="http://dx.com/p/zl-4-smart-car-chassis-kit-for-arduino-black-yellow-152992" target="_blank">http://dx.com/p/zl-4-<wbr />smart-car-chassis-kit-for-ardu<wbr />ino-black-yellow-152992</a>
* [Cheap Arduino UNO](http://dx.com/p/diy-funduino-uno-r3-development-board-microcontroller-w-usb-cable-240588)
* [Cheap Motor Shield](http://dx.com/p/arduino-compatible-2-channel-relay-shield-module-138600)
* [Cheap Starter Kits](http://dx.com/s/arduino+starter+kit)
* [Temperature Sensor](http://dx.com/p/arduino-digital-temperature-humidity-sensor-module-121350)

##Other Arduino Starter Kits
* [Official Kit](http://store.arduino.cc/eu/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=2&amp;products_id=185)
* [Alpha Crucis](http://www.alpha-crucis.com/en/intermediaires/4082-arduino-starter-kit-370038669007.html)
* [Cool Components](http://www.coolcomponents.co.uk/catalog/arduino-starter-p-596.html)
* [SeeedStudio](http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/ardx-the-starter-kit-for-arduino-p-1153.html?cPath=138)

## US Suppliers
Sparkfun and Adafruit are the main ones. Can be pricey to buy from US due to postage and import duties.

## UK Suppliers
[Cool Components](http://www.coolcomponents.co.uk) are good but postage can be pricey

## French Suppliers
[Alpha Crucis](http://www.alpha-crucis.com/en/intermediaires/4082-arduino-starter-kit-370038669007.html) seems like good value, particularly when Euro weak, but I haven't used them yet.

## Irish Suppliers
[Farnell](http://ie.farnell.com/) has a large Irish warehouse. Incredible selection of components mainly targeting Trade. But cheapest way to get Raspberry Pi in Ireland. They have a minimum order of €20 but then deliver by courier which is good. If you need to bulk buy wires, switches, ICs etc, they are the best/fastest option.


## Makey Makey
Available on [their own site](http://www.makeymakey.com/) and on [Sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11511) in the US and [Cool Components](http://www.coolcomponents.co.uk/catalog/makey-makey-standard-p-1091.html) in the UK

## Bare Conductive Ink
[On their own site](http://www.bareconductive.com/) in the UK.

## Maplin RPi Kit
Everything you need in one box on the [Maplin site](http://www.maplin.co.uk/raspberry-pi-board-and-starter-kit-652805).

They had them in Maplin Blackpool the last time I was there (opposite Argos). Approx €95. Not cheap but you are guaranteed that all the parts will work together. The RPi is particularly finnicky about USB devices and power supplies.

## i-racer
From [Cool Components](http://www.coolcomponents.co.uk/catalog/racer-p-993.html) in the UK or [Sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11162) in the US.


## Remote Control Car Batteries
[Hobbyking](http://www.hobbyking.com/) is best for these type of batteries. Hong Kong store has biggest range but obviously longest delay. UK store has quite a bit of stock but charges a lot for postage. I use [Parcel Motel](http://www.parcelmotel.com/) to order from UK store at UK postage rates and then collect in Bandon:

* [LiPo Battery](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__26653__Turnigy_nano_tech_2200mah_2S_35_70C_Lipo_Pack_UK_Warehouse_.html)

* [Low battery alarm](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__22749__On_Board_Lipoly_Low_Voltage_Alarm_2s_3s.html)
