      <description>&lt;p&gt;#&amp;ldquo;Android soon for \u008030?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally got my two-year upgrade on Vodafone Ireland. Had a look at what&amp;#39;s on offer. N97-mini for 120 is good value but I hate resistive screens and the lack of memory.&lt;p /&gt;Oh, what&amp;#39;s this? The Vodafone H1 360 for 30? A linux-based phone, social media enabled, 5 MP camera, wifi, 3G, bluetooth, Cortex A8 kick-ass CPU, lots of memory. Is that a typo? No, it is 30.&lt;p /&gt; Read some reviews (particularly Ewan on Mobile Industry Review). Damn, the software is a horror. Crappy apps too.&lt;p /&gt;A wee bit of Googling. Yes! Someone had the same idea as me. Port Android to it.&lt;p /&gt;The hackers have barely got started but if they manage it, you could have something that has the equivalent hardware of a Nexus One, running Android. For 30.&lt;p /&gt; Poor Vodafone. I could have told them for free that they should have done that in the first place. Or buy Palm and use WebOS. &lt;p /&gt;Not this badly thought out, badly implemented, will-probably-get the-bullet-when-the-bungee-VP-moves-on-to-his-next-gig disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
