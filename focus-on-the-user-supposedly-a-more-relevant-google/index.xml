      <description>&lt;p&gt;#&amp;ldquo;Focus on the User - Supposedly a more \&amp;ldquo;relevant\&amp;rdquo; Google&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;How much better would social search be if Google surfaced results from all across the web? The results speak for themselves. We created a tool that uses Googles own relevance measurethe ranking of their organic search resultsto determine what social content should appear in the areas where Google+ results are currently hardcoded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the information in this demo comes from Google itself, and all of the ranking decisions are made by Google&amp;rsquo;s own algorithms. No other services or APIs are accessed.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A funny pointed site by some Facebook, MySpace and Twitter Engineers. Of course, if Facebook and Twitter just let Google index them instead, maybe Goog wouldn&amp;rsquo;t show a preference for its own site&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I&amp;rsquo;ll use the bookmarklet anyway for kicks n giggles.&lt;/p&gt;
