      <description>&lt;p&gt;#&amp;ldquo;Fun and games with LiPo batteries and cheap Android Tablets&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ebay.com/itm/3-7V-3500mAh-lithium-Battery-Rechargeable-Polymer-Li-Po-For-Tablet-PC-B-3768112-/321105035375?ssPageName=ADME:L:OC:IE:3160&#34;&gt;replacement LiPo battery&lt;/a&gt; arrived for my daughter&amp;rsquo;s Eken T02A ultra-cheap Android tablet yesterday. Only 2 weeks from China which isn&amp;rsquo;t bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://conoroneill.net/what-the-inside-of-an-e88-android-tablet-looks-like/&#34;&gt;As I mentioned before&lt;/a&gt;, the Eken&amp;rsquo;s battery life iscatastrophic Sometimes less than 45 mins. Even at idle, it dies in no time at all. I&amp;rsquo;m guessing one of its two cells isn&amp;rsquo;t actually functional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The eBay replacement quotes 3500mAh which I&amp;rsquo;ll take with a big grain of salt. But at least it was bigger and heavier than the 2x &amp;ldquo;2000mAh&amp;rdquo; that were in the Eken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/T2eC16hHJIQE9qUHu0VFBRZTd8Hccw60_12.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1024&#34; alt=&#34;$T2eC16hHJIQE9qUHu0VFBRZTd8Hccw~~60_12&#34; src=&#34;https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/T2eC16hHJIQE9qUHu0VFBRZTd8Hccw60_12.jpg&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;475&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swapping out seemed to be a doddle, just two wires to solder. Most of the eBay batteries come with a PCM (Protection Circuit Module) built-in. This ensures that the battery never completely drains and also doesn&amp;rsquo;t get overcharged. Both are lethal for LiPo batteries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I charged the Eken up with the new battery, which took forever on USB. But I saw this as a good thing. Then I pulled the power and tried to boot. Zip. Nada. Not even a flicker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started getting paranoid that the 2x batteries in the Eken were actually wired to give 7.4V and not 3.7V. But some multi-metering confirmed 3.7V on the originals. I wired them back in and the Eken booted fine. Weird. When I checked the new one disconnected from the Eken on the multimeter, it reported 3.7V too. But when it was connected to the Eken it said 0.8V.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I had a brainwave. I tested the connections on the battery side of the PCM. Aha, 3.7V. So something weird was happening with the PCM. My worry was that is was actually doing it&amp;rsquo;s job and the battery couldn&amp;rsquo;t supply enough current to power the Eken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But deep intake of breath and I swapped the PCM from the old battery and put it on the new one. Result! Eken booted and battery did not explode or melt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been unable to figure out if all PCMs are generic for a particular voltage or if they are specific to a battery type. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping the former. Anyone know? I&amp;rsquo;d hate for something to go wrong with this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now for the really good news. 2.5hrs mixed usage with the new battery and we&amp;rsquo;re still at 64%!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
