      <description>&lt;p&gt;#&amp;ldquo;PAYG data effectively 4x more on 3IRL than 3UK&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;in Ireland&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned my Pay As You Go Three UK SIM many times on Twitter. The value and customer friendliness of it is still unbeatable. Walk into a Three UK store, give them &amp;pound;10 and get a SIM with a ton of minutes, texts and 150MB data that lasts 90 days.Top it up with another tenner for good measure and that doesn&amp;rsquo;t expire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you use that SIM in Ireland (ROI), they text you to say that you get 10p per min call, free to receive, 10p per SMS and 10p/MB for data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now go to the Three Ireland site and look at their PAYG data deals. Oh that&amp;rsquo;s right, you get no data included with your &amp;euro;10 Free SIM. So how do you get data?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get 1GB per month add-on for &amp;euro;9.99. Perhaps someone in 3 Ireland can explain how a per month charge = Pay As You Go?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or I can get a mobile broadband deal. Because as we all know, data packets on your phone are entirely different to data packets on a broadband modem. Those deals are 1 day (500MB) at &amp;euro;5, 1 week (2GB) at &amp;euro;10 etc. On the surface, solid value. But no-one on PAYG needs 2GB in a week, they need less spread over a longer period. Otherwise they&amp;rsquo;ll just take pay monthly contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;rsquo;s say you pay your &amp;euro;5 for the one day. How much is data after that i.e. How much is it to Pay As I Go? 49c per MB. FOUR TIMES MORE than Three UK charges in Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FOUR TIMES MORE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had high hopes for Three being disruptive when they came to Ireland. The UK operation really is at the cutting edge of value for money and interesting services/devices. But obviously they saw that the Irish love nothing better than to be ripped off by mobile operators and figured they&amp;rsquo;d get a chunk of that action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll find your friendly Three UK Store at &amp;ldquo;3 STORE, 48A - 49 Buttercrane Shopping Centre, Newry, BT35 8HJ&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small warning tho. Don&amp;rsquo;t use it to receive calls/texts in the South. The people contacting you will be gouged by their local Irish mobile operator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
