<p>My ancient old Ford Mondeo (2001) is still going strong. In some ways I hate it for doing so. It&#39;s an appliance and I don&#39;t like appliances, I like things with character. Prior to it I only bought Citroens (BX, AX, Xantia) and I loved them dearly. But they were unreliable piles of junk assembled by drunks. Then, once we had kids, an appliance became necessary.</p>
<p>The &quot;New&quot; Mondeo was the second car in the renaissance of Ford. The first was the Focus in 1999. My wife had a Focus and it was as close to perfect a car as you could get. Interesting shapes inside and out, totally reliable and not a generic over-priced BMW. Her sister drove it for a few years after her and loved it too. The Mondeo kept the reliability of the Focus but was dead boring to look at, inside and out.</p>
<p>In 11 years, the only problems it has had are a badly designed handbrake and grab handles which pop out of the ceiling. It also loses the gas in the aircon too quickly and it needed a suspension joint replaced a few years ago. It gets one service a year across the road for 100+ and that&#39;s it.</p>
<p>120,000 miles later and it bombs up and down the M7/M8 like a new car.</p>
<p>But in all this time, one thing has bugged me every day. The dashboard has a stippled effect which is a magnet for dust but is also impossible to attach anything too. Particularly phone holders. So I&#39;ve always had to attach them to the windscreen. The problem there is that the angle of the screen is so severe, it is always awkward, in landscape-mode, far away and murdered by glare. In France, on holidays in July, the HTC Sensation overheated so badly using Google Maps Navigation that a 2 Amp charger couldn&#39;t keep the battery charged!</p>
<p>Then yesterday, 11 years later, I had a brainwave. Sugru:</p>

<p>And ye know what? It flippin works!</p>
<p>Here&#39;s to another 120,000 miles.</p>
