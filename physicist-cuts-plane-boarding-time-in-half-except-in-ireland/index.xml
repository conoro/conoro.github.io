      <description>&lt;p&gt;#&amp;ldquo;Physicist cuts plane boarding time in half - Except in Ireland&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;posterous_bookmarklet_entry&#34;&gt;
 &lt;blockquote class=&#34;posterous_long_quote&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This savings could be as much as $110,000,000 annually per carrier&amp;ndash;well over a billion dollars for the industry&amp;ndash;and likely could be more given the parallel nature of the boarding process,&amp;rdquo; Steffen writes in a recent &lt;a href=&#34;http://arxiv.org/abs/1108.5211&#34;&gt;follow-up paper&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;ldquo;Indeed, a test with a longer aircraft may show surprising results in this regard.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/embed/o9-XjEI8VmA&#34; allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;487&#34; width=&#34;610&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;posterous_quote_citation&#34;&gt;via &lt;a href=&#34;http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20099450-1/physicist-cuts-plane-boarding-time-in-half/&#34;&gt;news.cnet.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;As anyone who travels regularly know, 97% of Irish people are genetically incapable of boarding a plane quickly, efficiently or correctly. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best example of this that I encountered was on a recent Ryanair flight to Stansted. The person in front of me got on the plane via the rear door, decided to pick the second-last seat, spent several minutes dicking around in the aisle with their bags and finally turns around and asks &#34;oh did you want to get past?&#34;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You also see people with no hand-baggage queuing for a plane with assigned seating, before the plane has even landed. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So whilst the Steffen Method looks wonderful, the only way it will work here is if cattle prods were involved. I would love to see Ryanair try this. The cattle prods I mean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
