      <description>&lt;p&gt;#&amp;ldquo;Anyone else seeing Facebook Likes incorrectly attributed to them?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think Facebook may have a big bug on their hands. I just Liked the Obama computer video on Gawker. It&amp;#39;s showing up in my stream. But it is also showing up as Liked by my wife who is on the same router. She never clicked Like on it.&lt;p /&gt;&lt;div&gt;So either there is some IP address NAT weirdness going on with Facebook or there is a screw-up related to cookie somewhere on this notebook from months back, which would be the last time she used this computer. &lt;p /&gt;&lt;div&gt;Anyone else seeing weirdness?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
