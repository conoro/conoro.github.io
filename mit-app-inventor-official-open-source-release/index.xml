      <description>&lt;p&gt;#&amp;ldquo;MIT App Inventor Official Open-Source Release&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m really pleased to see this release happen. Dec/Jan was an awkward time as Google dropped App Inventor and MIT didn&amp;rsquo;t have their site ready. MIT has done a sterling job since and it&amp;rsquo;s great to know that the &lt;a href=&#34;http://appinventor.mit.edu/appinventor-sources/&#34;&gt;full up-to-date source code is available&lt;/a&gt;. I hope a community of contributors to the codebase now starts building up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One issue we ran into in our school with accessing the main MIT site and GAE was a lack of bandwidth. When you have 15 laptops all trying to download/upload Java Apps to the internet on a connection that I think is 512kbs, you are going to have problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So a private local App Inventor install means we could provision an old PC as an Ubuntu server in the school and serve everything over local wifi. I hope the dev server capabilities are improved beyond &amp;ldquo;a few users&amp;rdquo; so we can remove the dependency on Google App Engine and provide a trouble free setup for the kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
