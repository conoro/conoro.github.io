      <description>&lt;p&gt;#&amp;rdquo;\&amp;ldquo;Games You May Like on Facebook\&amp;ldquo;. That&amp;rsquo;d be None. Why are Ads so broken in 2012?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Facebook paid even a minutes notice to the intention graph rather than the social graph, they&amp;rsquo;d see that I relentlessly click Hide on all mentions of games. Then maybe they could avoid wasting their valuable screen real-estate pimping something I will never ever ever click on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also had a look at some of the ads on FB today. Bloody hell, not a single solitary thing I&amp;rsquo;m remotely interested in. Just because I&amp;rsquo;m friends/family with someone on Facebook does not mean I share any of their interests. But when we talk about a movie/TV show/book/product, then you&amp;rsquo;ve got some useful data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the amount of Likes and Shares I do on Facebook, it really is shocking that they can&amp;rsquo;t find one thing to recommend to me that I&amp;rsquo;d actually buy. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t surprise me at all that their Ad revenue has flattened out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really hope someone out there is working on an all new Ads system. I don&amp;rsquo;t mind Ads, I really don&amp;rsquo;t, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t clicked on one in a very long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the amount of &amp;ldquo;stuff&amp;rdquo; I generate online, someone should be able to nail me with ads I can&amp;rsquo;t resist. Yet here we are in 2012 and I still find out about most of the products I buy from people I follow on Twitter/Facebook/Google+, Blogs and Friends. Personal recommendations plus a selection of online reviews seals the deal. There must be a way of packaging that up algorithmic-ally without turning everyone into shills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst I&amp;rsquo;m on the subject, can all the re-marketing systems please add a button to their Ads called &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve already bloody bought it, stop hounding me.&amp;rdquo;? Also another one for all the deals Ads which says &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m a man, I don&amp;rsquo;t need an upper lip electrolysis deal of the day&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, if an Ad system was announced which said &amp;ldquo;Give us access to your Twitter/Facebook/Google+/Reader/Amazon/4SQ/Yelp accounts and we promise to only show you Ads/Deals for stuff you and your friends talk about positively&amp;rdquo;, I&amp;rsquo;d opt-in tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile here&amp;rsquo;s a sponsored Tweet from Coke.&lt;/p&gt;
