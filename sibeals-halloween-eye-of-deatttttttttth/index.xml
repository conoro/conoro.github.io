      <description>&lt;p&gt;#&amp;ldquo;Sib\u00e9al&amp;rsquo;s Halloween Eye of Deatttttttttth&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Myself and Sibal put together a really simple but effective spooky eye for Halloween recently. It caused great interest in her school during Halloween dress-up day just before mid-term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It simply consists of an old ping-pong ball with a hole dremeled into it and large bright red LED inserted into the hole. That&amp;rsquo;s connected via a resistor and long wires down her arm to her wrist which has a PP9 battery taped to it. That leads to an on-off switch in her hand so she can catch people unaware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Workspace-1_006.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Workspace-1_006.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;Workspace 1_006&#34; width=&#34;876&#34; height=&#34;653&#34; class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-896&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is genuinely scary in the dark and the bright LED created freaky concentric circles which were missing when we used a smaller duller LED.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main things it made us think of were Terminator, the Daleks and Davros.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time to start planning next Halloween.&lt;/p&gt;
