I&#39;m a long-time customer of theirs and I&#39;m a huge fan. Their Dash Genie in-car phone holder is a wonderful thing that just works.</p>
<p>They asked if I wanted to review anything on their site and I cheekily requested a pair of Motorola S10-HD headphones. They shot a pair over to me for free immediately.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve had them for a few weeks and they are just superb. Like a fool, I bought a pair of S9&#39;s on eBay a few years ago. I didn&#39;t suss that the only way they could be so cheap was if they were knock-offs. They fell apart in no time. These <em>real</em> S10-HD&#39;s are in a different league altogether.</p>

<p>The design is unusual in that they basically clamp on to your head. Some people with particularly big noggins report that they are uncomfortable but I found after two uses that they fit perfectly.</p>

<p>The reason I wanted them was for running. I hate the normal in-ear wired headphones that fall out constantly and tie you in knots with the wires as you run. With these, I pair via Bluetooth A2DP to my HTC Sensation strapped to my arm and I listen to all my podcasts and music. It has volume and track selection buttons on one side.</p>
<p>However it also works as a handsfree for the phone. If you are listening to music when an incoming call arrives, it mutes it and you can press a button to accept the call. I tested this paired to my laptop and made a few perfect quality Skype calls with it.</p>

<p>The big test was this morning where I ran a sweaty Bandon 10km and listened to Kermode and Mayo&#39;s movie reviews for an hour. I was chuffed that they worked perfectly, never slipped and did not hurt after an hour. I assume the same will be true when I do the Cork Half Marathon in June. Run Keeper is also able to temporarily mute the podcast and tell me my pace every 1km. Nice.</p>
<p>Not much more to say. They work perfectly. They come with a variety of ear-plug sizes and they are great value. I&#39;ll be using nothing else from now on when running.</p>
<p>Thanks again to the Mobile Fun crew. Still the first site I go to when I want to get something for my phone.</p>
<p>UPDATE June 5th 2012: I ran the Cork Half Marathon yesterday with the S10-HD connected to my HTC Sensation. They worked beautifully. No battery issues, no drop-outs and my head wasn&#39;t sore afterwards. Which is more than can be said about the balls of my feet.</p>
