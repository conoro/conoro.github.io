      <description>&lt;p&gt;#&amp;ldquo;Anyone got a workflow engine for Wordpress?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been making my own little client sign-up workflow inside Wordpress but there is a definite opportunity for someone to build a mini-workflow-engine for WP.&lt;p /&gt;&lt;div&gt;Just pages/forms with strong conditional logic and branching and go-back. My kludge with a long page hierarchy, smart url naming and Gravity Forms will do in the short term but I could really do with the branching to separate pages based on input to forms (e.g. different billing selections). And not having to worry about url changes breaking the flow.&lt;p /&gt;&lt;div&gt;So basically Documentum for (almost)free, re-written in PHP and in a couple of megs. Takers? C&amp;#39;monnnnnnn.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p /&gt;&lt;p /&gt;&lt;p /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
