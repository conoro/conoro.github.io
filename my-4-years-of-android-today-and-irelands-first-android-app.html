<p>Today is the 4th anniversary of me paying $499 on eBay for a HTC G1, the first Android phone. Whilst some of my tech predictions over the years have been a little off (<em>cough</em> iPad) I couldn&#39;t have got it more right with Android.</p>
<p>When I heard about the Android project mid-2008, it was obvious Google wasn&#39;t going into things half-heartedly. The G1 itself was a mixed bag. Ugly as sin but with a slide-out keyboard that I still love. Android 1.5 was rough but very functional for someone like me who spends their time on Google products like GMail. I still have the G1, running Android 2.3 and waking me up every morning.</p>
<p>The reason I got the G1 was not for pointless bragging rights, it was because we had decided to build an Android App to show-off the <a href="http://www.loudervoice.com/products/enterprise-reviews/">LouderVoice</a> API to some Enterprise customers we were trying to land in the mobile space.</p>
<p>I created the spec and wireframes for the App and also figured out what extra features our API would need. The basic idea was &quot;Review Anything Anywhere&quot;. Essentially what Kevin Rose tried to do with Oink several years later. We both failed because no-one wants to do that :-)</p>
<p>Marino Software in Dublin did the App coding for us and we finally launched <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.marinosoftware.loudervoice&amp;feature=search_result">Ireland&#39;s first Android App</a> in May 2009 for Android 1.6. It never had many users but it was a fantastic tool for showing potential business customers what our system could do.</p>
<p>The same back-end API is now used to power the reviews in the Riverdance Android and iPhone Apps.</p>
<p>Last week I installed the old App again on my HTC Sensation running Android 4.1.2 and whaddyaknow, it still works! Sure the graphics-scaling is horrific on that big screen but you can still browse and submit reviews to our API.</p>
<p>In those 4 years I&#39;ve gone through a HTC G1, HTC Desire and HTC Sensation. I&#39;ve also bought a ZTE Blade and Eken T02 tablet for others. There is no doubt that my next phone will be Android but sadly not HTC, as I insist on my phones having replaceable battery and SD card. At some point next year I&#39;ll get a decent Android Tablet too.</p>
<p>There are two upcoming areas I find exciting in the world of Android:</p>
<p><ol>
    <li><strong>Ultra-cheap single board Android computers in the style of Raspberry Pi</strong>. Most of these are being sold as <a href="http://dx.com/s/android.html?category=191">1080p media players</a> but <a href="http://apc.io/">they can do a hell of a lot more</a> for very little money. Which feeds into point 2.</li>
    <li><strong>Hardware interfaces like IOIO</strong>. Once I finish a couple of my fun Raspberry Pi and Arduino projects, I want to do some car projects using <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10748">IOIO</a>. Rather than your phone/tablet just being for calls/music/GPS in the car, imagine if it was connected to a wide range of sensors and interfaces. Every car on the road acting as a generator of a wide range of interesting IoT data, all location-tagged and uploaded live over a mobile data connection.</li>
</ol>
We&#39;ve come a long way baby.</p>
