      <description>&lt;p&gt;#&amp;ldquo;Imagine if Minecraft was the trigger to get a new generation of kids programming?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet tw-align-center&#34;&gt;If you want to know what the social network of the future will look like, forget twitter, facebook &amp;amp; &lt;a title=&#34;http://App.net&#34; href=&#34;http://t.co/Dw8wVfPG&#34;&gt;App.net&lt;/a&gt;. Look at Minecraft&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walter Higgins (@walter) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/walter/status/235354661996068864&#34; data-datetime=&#34;2012-08-14T12:38:18+00:00&#34;&gt;August 14, 2012&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://walterhiggins.net/blog/&#34;&gt;Walter&lt;/a&gt; thinks that the next big Social Network will be &lt;a href=&#34;https://minecraft.net/&#34;&gt;Minecraft&lt;/a&gt;. I think he might be on to something. Our kids either love playing it or watching their older siblings do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend, it was announced that the Pocket Edition was being &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/2565&#34;&gt;ported to the Raspberry Pi&lt;/a&gt;. I was excited but our eldest son pooh-poohed the news since he has tried Pocket on his Android phone and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t compare to the full thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then came the kicker: you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to access it programatically in any language over a network connection! As they point out in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/2603&#34;&gt;the blogpost today&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The more creative programmer will only be limited by their imagination. Want to build a digital clock into the wall of your house which displays the real time? Easy. Want to get back at a friend who stole your precious diamonds? Remove the floor from underneath their feet and let them fall into a pit of lava. The possibilities are endless.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the future is mobile, then is Pocket Minecraft on Raspberry Pi = the Tween replacement for Twitter?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a big deal. I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to try it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UPDATE 1: I just realised the GPIO pins on the RPi mean that it should be possible to connect haptic/gesture/wiimote/any interfaces to Minecraft. Or have people been doing that already on the PC version? I&amp;rsquo;ve just ordered a Makey Makey and you could have huge fun with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
