      <description>&lt;p&gt;#&amp;ldquo;How to get a US Phone Number for your Irish Business for Free&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was reminded of our phone setup yesterday when asked how we have implemented our US number. The easiest way is obviously to pay Blueface VOIP or Skype for a US number. But you can actually do it for zero cost which is how we have done it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic setup is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/voice&#34;&gt;Google Voice&lt;/a&gt; US number (We chose a Palo Alto area code, cos, wellllll, cos)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That GV number is forwarded to a free &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ipkall.com/&#34;&gt;IPKall&lt;/a&gt; Washington State VOIP number (GV will only forward to US number and the old Gizmo tricks don&amp;rsquo;t seem to work since Google bought them)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That IPKall number forwarded for free via SIP to our Irish &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.blueface.ie/&#34;&gt;Blueface&lt;/a&gt; number&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you get a PAYG account with Blueface then none of the above costs you anything for inbound calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have had that configured for months now and it works perfectly. If you don&amp;rsquo;t get many US calls (we do), then you just need to ring either the GV number or IPKall number once a month to keep the IPKall account active. GV means that you get all your voicemails transcribed to text and emailed to you. Much hilarity can be had with these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internally we have a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.blueface.ie/helpandadvice/configuration/pap2.aspx&#34;&gt;Linksys PAP2&lt;/a&gt; connected to the LAN and an el-cheapo Motorola DECT phone connected to that. The Linksys is configured to connect to Blueface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One really cool feature is that Caller ID kinda works on a Geo basis. When one of our partners calls the GV number from Wisconsin, it doens&amp;rsquo;t show his number but it does show &amp;ldquo;Wasau, WI&amp;rdquo; on the phone, so I know who it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one small glitch you have to deal with in the setup tho. You cannot create a Google Voice account from Ireland. For that you need to use a VPN to spoof you are in the US. We use &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.blackvpn.com/&#34;&gt;BlackVPN&lt;/a&gt; which always works well. Gimme a shout if you want our discount code. You&amp;rsquo;ll get BlackVPN free for 2 months and we&amp;rsquo;ll get an extra month free. Once the GV account is setup, you can access it from any country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or as I said just pay Blueface or Skype and save yourself the hassle. That&amp;rsquo;s what we do for our UK number :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
