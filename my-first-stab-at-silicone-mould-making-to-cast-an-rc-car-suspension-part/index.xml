      <description>&lt;p&gt;#&amp;ldquo;My first stab at silicone mould making to cast an RC car suspension part&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regular readers will know that I&amp;rsquo;m a huge fan of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://conoroneill.net/makey-makey-raspberry-pi-iracer-bluetooth-cheese-controlled-car-ccc/&#34;&gt;Dagu Arexx i-racer RC car&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s cheap, light, fast, uses Bluetooth, has a removable shell and is perfect for n00b families like us who have never really done the RC thing properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/iracer-300x300.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately after some over-exhuberant use recently, we broke a part of the suspension on one of the front wheels. Over the space of a few weeks I tried everything to fix it without success. That included:
&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Trying to hand-mould thermo-plastic onto the remaining suspension member to rebuild the broken bit. It refused to stick&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Supergluing pieces of metalonto the remaining suspension member. They fell off.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Soldering metal and wire onto the wheel hub to completely replace theremaining suspension member. This worked but was so loose and bendy that the car just drove around in circles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2013-06-07-20.47.48.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-large wp-image-1103&#34; alt=&#34;2013-06-07 20.47.48&#34; src=&#34;https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2013-06-07-20.47.48-1024x576.jpg&#34; width=&#34;584&#34; height=&#34;328&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the back of my mind I started justifying the cost of a 3D printer even tho I knew they were unsuitable for things that small.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had pretty much given up when I read &lt;a href=&#34;http://hackaday.com/2012/10/17/moulding-new-gears-for-a-micro-helicopter/&#34;&gt;a post on Hack A Day&lt;/a&gt; about a guy creating new gears for his RC helicopter using silicone moulds and polyurethane resin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last time I tried to mould something was when I was about 12 and my sister got one of those castle-making kits where you had to make each &amp;ldquo;tile&amp;rdquo; from plastercast in green moulds first and then glue them together. Infuriating thing. What was that called? Can&amp;rsquo;t figure it out from Google.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this guy&amp;rsquo;s approach looked perfect and appeared to make a strong item.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I ordered some &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Mouldcraft-GP-RTV-325-Shore-A25-255g-Silicone-Mould-Making-Rubber-Kit-/261082208350?ssPageName=ADME:L:OC:IE:3160&#34;&gt;GP-325 RTV Silicone Mould Making Rubber&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/MOULDCRAFT-A2000L-120gm-Fast-Cast-Polyurethane-Liquid-Plastic-Casting-Resin-kit-/251095395566?ssPageName=ADME:L:OC:IE:3160&#34;&gt;A2000L Easycast Polyurethane resin&lt;/a&gt; from a UK seller on eBay recently and it arrived last week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure how to approach it so I just got stuck in. I removed the matching suspension part from the other wheel and put it in a plastic cup.I then mixed the two parts of the silicone as instructed and poured it over. Due to a rubbish kitchen electronic scales I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure if the mix was correct so I let it dry for 24 hrs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I popped the dry rubber out of the cup and could see the outline of the piece. I gently cut in with a blade and was shocked when the piece came out with no aggro and left behind a really impressive impression. The fact that the central hole was moulded perfectly too was the big surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phase two was less straightforward. I mixed the polyurethane and poured it into the mould. Despite tapping and squeezing etc, what came out an hour later was pretty stunted. I obviously had big issues with air pockets. So I cut away a bit at the top of the mould to make it easier for air to get out and the mixture to get in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second one was better but still not right. More rubber cutting ensued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-large wp-image-1104&#34; alt=&#34;2013-06-08 18.00.11&#34; src=&#34;https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2013-06-08-18.00.11-1024x576.jpg&#34; width=&#34;584&#34; height=&#34;328&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third mix was all wrong and never set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth time&amp;rsquo;s a charm and I got a &amp;ldquo;perfect&amp;rdquo; copy of the original. Obviously with lots of extra bits which I had to cut away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/moulds.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-large wp-image-1106&#34; alt=&#34;moulds&#34; src=&#34;https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/moulds-1024x576.jpg&#34; width=&#34;584&#34; height=&#34;328&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I gave it about 16 hrs to cure, just in case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2013-06-08-01.00.05.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-large wp-image-1107&#34; alt=&#34;2013-06-08 01.00.05&#34; src=&#34;https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2013-06-08-01.00.05-1024x576.jpg&#34; width=&#34;584&#34; height=&#34;328&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A tiny amount of trimming and it fit perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/wheels.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-large wp-image-1108&#34; alt=&#34;wheels&#34; src=&#34;https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/wheels-1024x576.jpg&#34; width=&#34;584&#34; height=&#34;328&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m genuinely stunned. I didn&amp;rsquo;t really expect a great result here but I got exactly what I needed. This method is amazing and so bloody easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2013-06-08-12.38.25.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-large wp-image-1109&#34; alt=&#34;2013-06-08 12.38.25&#34; src=&#34;https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2013-06-08-12.38.25-1024x576.jpg&#34; width=&#34;584&#34; height=&#34;328&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the downside, I am concerned about the strength of the cast. Particularly the vertical bit which is what broke in the original too. I&amp;rsquo;m tempted to do another cast where I run a thin wire in the correct place to add some robustness. Having the mould means I can make as many of these as I like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there any retail outlet in Cork/Dublin that sells the materials to do this kind of moulding? It&amp;rsquo;d be great to talk to someone who has done lots of it before about improving strength and flexibility and playing with the mix ratios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll update this when I&amp;rsquo;ve had a chance to test the car out properly.&lt;/p&gt;
