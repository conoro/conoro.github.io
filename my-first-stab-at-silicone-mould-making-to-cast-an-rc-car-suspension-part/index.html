                        <p>#&ldquo;My first stab at silicone mould making to cast an RC car suspension part&rdquo;</p>

<p>Regular readers will know that I&rsquo;m a huge fan of the <a href="http://conoroneill.net/makey-makey-raspberry-pi-iracer-bluetooth-cheese-controlled-car-ccc/">Dagu Arexx i-racer RC car</a>. It&rsquo;s cheap, light, fast, uses Bluetooth, has a removable shell and is perfect for n00b families like us who have never really done the RC thing properly.</p>

<p><img class="alignnone" alt="" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/iracer-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></p>

<p>Unfortunately after some over-exhuberant use recently, we broke a part of the suspension on one of the front wheels. Over the space of a few weeks I tried everything to fix it without success. That included:
<ol>
    <li>Trying to hand-mould thermo-plastic onto the remaining suspension member to rebuild the broken bit. It refused to stick</li>
    <li>Supergluing pieces of metalonto the remaining suspension member. They fell off.</li>
    <li>Soldering metal and wire onto the wheel hub to completely replace theremaining suspension member. This worked but was so loose and bendy that the car just drove around in circles.</li>
</ol>
<a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2013-06-07-20.47.48.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1103" alt="2013-06-07 20.47.48" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2013-06-07-20.47.48-1024x576.jpg" width="584" height="328" /></a></p>

<p>In the back of my mind I started justifying the cost of a 3D printer even tho I knew they were unsuitable for things that small.</p>

<p>I had pretty much given up when I read <a href="http://hackaday.com/2012/10/17/moulding-new-gears-for-a-micro-helicopter/">a post on Hack A Day</a> about a guy creating new gears for his RC helicopter using silicone moulds and polyurethane resin.</p>

<p>The last time I tried to mould something was when I was about 12 and my sister got one of those castle-making kits where you had to make each &ldquo;tile&rdquo; from plastercast in green moulds first and then glue them together. Infuriating thing. What was that called? Can&rsquo;t figure it out from Google.</p>

<p>But this guy&rsquo;s approach looked perfect and appeared to make a strong item.</p>

<p>So I ordered some <a href="http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Mouldcraft-GP-RTV-325-Shore-A25-255g-Silicone-Mould-Making-Rubber-Kit-/261082208350?ssPageName=ADME:L:OC:IE:3160">GP-325 RTV Silicone Mould Making Rubber</a> and <a href="http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/MOULDCRAFT-A2000L-120gm-Fast-Cast-Polyurethane-Liquid-Plastic-Casting-Resin-kit-/251095395566?ssPageName=ADME:L:OC:IE:3160">A2000L Easycast Polyurethane resin</a> from a UK seller on eBay recently and it arrived last week.</p>

<p>I really wasn&rsquo;t sure how to approach it so I just got stuck in. I removed the matching suspension part from the other wheel and put it in a plastic cup.I then mixed the two parts of the silicone as instructed and poured it over. Due to a rubbish kitchen electronic scales I wasn&rsquo;t sure if the mix was correct so I let it dry for 24 hrs.</p>

<p>I popped the dry rubber out of the cup and could see the outline of the piece. I gently cut in with a blade and was shocked when the piece came out with no aggro and left behind a really impressive impression. The fact that the central hole was moulded perfectly too was the big surprise.</p>

<p>Phase two was less straightforward. I mixed the polyurethane and poured it into the mould. Despite tapping and squeezing etc, what came out an hour later was pretty stunted. I obviously had big issues with air pockets. So I cut away a bit at the top of the mould to make it easier for air to get out and the mixture to get in.</p>

<p>The second one was better but still not right. More rubber cutting ensued.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1104" alt="2013-06-08 18.00.11" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2013-06-08-18.00.11-1024x576.jpg" width="584" height="328" /></p>

<p>The third mix was all wrong and never set.</p>

<p>Fourth time&rsquo;s a charm and I got a &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; copy of the original. Obviously with lots of extra bits which I had to cut away.</p>

<p><a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/moulds.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1106" alt="moulds" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/moulds-1024x576.jpg" width="584" height="328" /></a></p>

<p>I gave it about 16 hrs to cure, just in case.</p>

<p><a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2013-06-08-01.00.05.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1107" alt="2013-06-08 01.00.05" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2013-06-08-01.00.05-1024x576.jpg" width="584" height="328" /></a></p>

<p>A tiny amount of trimming and it fit perfectly.</p>

<p><a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/wheels.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1108" alt="wheels" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/wheels-1024x576.jpg" width="584" height="328" /></a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m genuinely stunned. I didn&rsquo;t really expect a great result here but I got exactly what I needed. This method is amazing and so bloody easy.</p>

<p><a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2013-06-08-12.38.25.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1109" alt="2013-06-08 12.38.25" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2013-06-08-12.38.25-1024x576.jpg" width="584" height="328" /></a></p>

<p>On the downside, I am concerned about the strength of the cast. Particularly the vertical bit which is what broke in the original too. I&rsquo;m tempted to do another cast where I run a thin wire in the correct place to add some robustness. Having the mould means I can make as many of these as I like.</p>

<p>Is there any retail outlet in Cork/Dublin that sells the materials to do this kind of moulding? It&rsquo;d be great to talk to someone who has done lots of it before about improving strength and flexibility and playing with the mix ratios.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll update this when I&rsquo;ve had a chance to test the car out properly.</p>
