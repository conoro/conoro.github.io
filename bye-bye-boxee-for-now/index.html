<p> <p>I&#39;ve been a <a href="http://www.boxee.tv/">Boxee</a> fanatic since I first installed it over two years ago. We had been running <a href="http://xbmc.org/">XBMC</a> on several old XBOXes (and still do) but they couldn&#39;t handle x.264 video or HDMI so when I built a media PC, I used Boxee. I am absolutely convinced their focus on social is the right way to go. Social watching of TV in 2011 is barely scratching the surface of what&#39;s possible.</p></p>
<p><p /></p>
<div>But Brooklyn, we have a problem. Development on the non-Boxee-Box codebase has ground to a halt. All of their efforts are now on the Boxee Box. And rightly so. When you have VC investment, your job is to generate a return, not bug-fix free code for geeks. Particularly when you are a small team, you have to prioritise revenue generation.</div>
<p />
<div>We did some moving around of PCs recently with the result that the media PC is now running Ubuntu 10.10 x86-64 instead of Windows. I happily did this in the knowledge that there was a Boxee installer for this setup. What I had forgotten was what a pain in the ass it is to do anything with video and decent video cards on Linux. Then I found that Boxee crashed trying to play any video. Argghhh.</div>
<p />
<div>In parallel to this I discovered that XBMC (the code that Boxee is based on) had been in heavy development on PCs over the past few years. It has versions for Windows and Ubuntu too. I was forced to give it a go due to the Boxee problems and was pleasantly surprised to find that it&#39;s very good indeed (apart from the 1980s Amstrad twin-tape-deck shiny black colour scheme).&nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>A few video glitches on XBMC made me try the ATI-AMD proprietary video driver instead of the OpenSource one. It didn&#39;t solve the XBMC pause-restart glitch but it did make Boxee work. In black and white :-(</div>
<p />
<div>I then tried a nightly build of XBMC and wow! All of the TV show preview stuff is brilliant, including episode synopses. Development is obviously moving ahead quickly.</div>
<p />
<div>I continue to recommend Boxee Boxes to anyone who asks me about media centres but I don&#39;t have $200 spare to buy something that I can already do via the media PC. Hopefully the Boxee guys will sort out the Ubuntu problems at some point and then I&#39;ll be back. But for now, XBMC it is.</div>
