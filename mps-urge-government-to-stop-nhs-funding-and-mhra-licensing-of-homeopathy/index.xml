      <description>&lt;p&gt;#&amp;ldquo;MPs urge government to stop NHS funding, and MHRA licensing, of homeopathy&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;posterous_bookmarklet_entry&#34;&gt;
 &lt;blockquote class=&#34;posterous_long_quote&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was a challenging inquiry which provoked strong reactions. We were seeking to determine whether the Governments policies on homeopathy are evidence based on current evidence. They are not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sets an unfortunate precedent for the Department of Health to consider that the existence of a community which believes that homeopathy works is evidence enough to continue spending public money on it. This also sends out a confused message, and has potentially harmful consequences. We await the Governments response to our report with interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Nice to see the British have MPs with some cop-on. Great news for evidence-based medicine instead of voodoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
