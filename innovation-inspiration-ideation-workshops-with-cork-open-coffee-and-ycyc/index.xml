      <description>&lt;p&gt;#&amp;ldquo;Innovation, inspiration &amp;amp; ideation workshops with Cork Open Coffee and YCYC&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;posterous_bookmarklet_entry&#34;&gt;
 &lt;blockquote class=&#34;posterous_long_quote&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.yourcountryyourcall.com/&#34;&gt;Your Country, Your Call&lt;/a&gt; is pleased to announce a series of innovation, inspiration &amp;amp; ideation workshops designed to inspire creative thinking and help people bring their ideas to life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workshops, which are open to the public are free of charge and one will take place in Cork as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cork: 9th April 11.00 am, National Software Centre Campus, Mahon.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;posterous_quote_citation&#34;&gt;via &lt;a href=&#34;http://corkopencoffee.org/2010/03/30/innovation-inspiration-ideation-workshops-with-cork-open-coffee/&#34;&gt;corkopencoffee.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;I&#39;m thrilled to see YCYC come to Cork OpenCoffee and talk to the startup community in Cork. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fantastic job by Gordon Murray in putting this together with everyone involved.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also think it&#39;s a great opportunity for everyone who has issues with and criticisms of YCYC to express them out in the open and have them addressed clearly by those involved in it. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll definitely be there and I hope to see all of you too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
