      <description>&lt;p&gt;#&amp;ldquo;Some HTC Desire Problems&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had the Desire for a while now and generally I&amp;rsquo;m a huge fan. Best phone I&amp;rsquo;ve ever owned. But there are some big glitches which drive me mad and a lot of them arerelatedto the RF bits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In noparticularorder:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loses ability to connect to known+remembered Wifi access points and I have to disable/re-enable Wifi to get it to work. Particularly annoying when you were relying on it to download the lastest podcasts overnight and it couldn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loses ability to communicate over mobile data if it has spent a long time going in and out of poor signal area. Reboot needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wifi interferes with A2DP Bluetooth audio streaming to my car stereo (audio cuts out for 1 second every 10 seconds). Must be disabled. Yes I could use an audio cable but if I am alsochargingthe phone, the electrical noise of the car comes out through the stereo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking of which, are there car cigarette lighter noise filters?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actual RF performance not as good as any Nokia. Have to re-send SMS multiple times in location where Nokia will squeeze it out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All of the above problems were in the old G1 as well so it&amp;rsquo;s a systematic problem with HTC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I am playing a podcast it will often signal an inbound call by randomly playing a song on the phone. This is one of the most confusing things to ever happen to me, particularly since I was driving and also because it didn&amp;rsquo;t pause the podcast!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crashes fairly regularly if I use a lot of Wifi/3G/Bluetooth over a few days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trashed my SDCard and I had to reformat it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;None of that last three happened with the Cyanogen community firmware on the G1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The phone is totally locked down unlike its almost perfect clone, the Nexus One. So it is proving very difficult for it to be rooted so that community firmware can be used on it. Why do you care HTC? Particularly since Google makes it easy on the Nexus One. Would you not like some great community patches to become part of your offering?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The camera is pretty shite. Fine for static stuff but don&amp;rsquo;t dare move. Not a patch on the old N95-8GB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Battery life is hilariously bad. I could see the battery level race to zero in realtime as I streamed a podcast over 3G and listened to it with A2DP headphones. An extreme example I know but the phone became almost too hot to handle! Luckily, unlike the iPhone, you can replace the battery so I have 3.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The back cover isdefinitelygoing to become loose with the number of times I have to take it off to replace the battery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GPS went completely mental today. Decided I was in Banteer when I was actually 150 miles away in Dublin. And this was with it claiming full GPS lock. Needless to say, the otherwise excellent Navigation was pretty useless today.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why do I need to press a physical button and then swipe the screen to unlock it every bloody time?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The answer-call/ignore-call swipe thing is idiotic. Red and Green screen buttons please.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;rsquo;s the bad stuff. Plenty of good stuff coming tomorrow or Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
