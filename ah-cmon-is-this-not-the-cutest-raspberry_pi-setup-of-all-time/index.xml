      <description>&lt;p&gt;#&amp;ldquo;Ah c&amp;rsquo;mon, is this not the cutest @raspberry_pi setup of all time?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I splashed out a little on my main dev Raspberry Pi and finally got it a &lt;a href=&#34;http://shop.pimoroni.com/collections/pibow/products/pibow&#34;&gt;PiBow case&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve loved that design for so long, I had to succumb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/pibow2.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-large wp-image-1165&#34; alt=&#34;pibow2&#34; src=&#34;https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/pibow2-991x1024.jpg&#34; width=&#34;584&#34; height=&#34;603&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coincidentally the same company now has a brilliant new USB hub specifically for the RPi called &lt;a href=&#34;http://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pihub&#34;&gt;the PiHUB&lt;/a&gt;. Not only is it in that hilarious shape, but it also comes with a 3A PSU. This means you can add extra devices and power the Raspberry Pi off it. So far it&amp;rsquo;s been the most compatible hub I&amp;rsquo;ve tried with the RPi and we all know how dodgy it can be with hubs. It also solves the USB-splitter-cable mess I had devised to connect a portable harddrive to the RPi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing I got from Pimoroni was an &lt;a href=&#34;http://shop.pimoroni.com/collections/kits/products/adafruit-pi-t-cobbler-breakout-kit-for-raspberry-pi&#34;&gt;Adafruit Pi T-Cobbler&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s a simple breakout board for the Pi with no actual electronics. I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing so much connect/disconnect stuff on the RPi pins recently I was sure I&amp;rsquo;d short something out eventually. This just makes things a little easier and has all the pins labelled. Took about 5 minutes to solder it together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other thing I got recently was &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.7dayshop.com/7dayshop-wireless-air-mouse-keyboard-with-gyroscope-2-4ghz-1&#34;&gt;a cheapish air mouse&lt;/a&gt; from 7DayShop. This was actually more intended for XBMC/Raspbmc usage but I&amp;rsquo;ve realised it&amp;rsquo;s perfect for travel. I was happily able to use it as a mouse and keyboard for X-Windows when checking out Google Coder recently. The particular one I got has overly-small arrow keys but that&amp;rsquo;s really the only criticism I can make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only things I&amp;rsquo;m missing now are some raspberry coloured cables.&lt;/p&gt;
