<h2 id="intro:e19abcb8e6b6d101fc1a316dfdf4aa74">Intro</h2>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t blogged properly about the $5 <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspberry-pi-zero/">Raspberry Pi Zero</a> computer yet, despite Tweeting non-stop about it. I will soon. In the meantime, I&rsquo;ll just repeat that</p>

<p><em>It&rsquo;s a major moment in computing</em></p>

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/146893658" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>The inclusion of a free one on the cover of the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/magpi/raspberry-pi-zero-out-today-get-it-free-with-the-magpi-40/">MagPi Magazine</a> will be remembered for years to come.</p>

<p>The town in which I live, Bandon, flooded again recently, because Ireland. I&rsquo;ve had <a href="https://github.com/conoro/bandonfews-nodejs">a simple Node.js app</a> running on a Gen 1 Raspberry Pi B, scraping the <a href="http://www.bandonfloodwarning.ie/">Bandon Flood Warning</a> site every 15 minutes for the past four years and saving the data in <a href="https://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?docid=103YIcARoxuaWT7NfZ8mVBzY554sF_3ONYC1N3DE&amp;pli=1#chartnew:id=5">Google Fusion Tables</a>.</p>

<p>Yes that&rsquo;s how Cork County Council&rsquo;s/OPW&rsquo;s Flood Warning site looks in the middle of one of our biggest floods ever:</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/service_unavailable.jpg" alt="FEWS Unavailable" /></p>

<p>With all this flooding, I decided to finally create a related setup which takes the SMS Flood alerts from the County Council and auto-tweets them to the <a href="https://twitter.com/bandonfews">@BandonFEWS</a> Twitter account which I created and have manually updated since 2011.</p>

<h2 id="the-details:e19abcb8e6b6d101fc1a316dfdf4aa74">The Details</h2>

<p>So the final $7 hardware (including Wifi adapter) now looks as follows:</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pizero_fews.jpg" alt="PiZero FEWS" /></p>

<ul>
<li>My phone is registered with the Bandon Flood Warning site (it has been for years)</li>
<li>I have a <a href="https://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a> account with a $1 per month UK SMS number. Irish numbers are $6 per month :-(</li>
<li>SMSes are sent to my phone from Cork CoCo announcing a new flood warning level or severe weather alert (two different systems and numbers)</li>
<li>The Android <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm&amp;hl=en">Tasker App</a> watches for SMS from these sources with particular contents</li>
<li>Tasker auto-forwards these SMSes to my Twilio number</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/tasker.jpg" alt="Tasker" /></p>

<ul>
<li>I have the Twilio number configured to call a my simple API end-point with the SMS contents</li>
<li>The API end-point is running on one of my $5 Raspberry Pi Zeros and is written in <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a>. Code below.</li>
<li>The PiZero is behind my home router which is an <a href="https://www.asus.com/ie/Networking/RTAC68U/">Asus RT-AC68</a> so somehow Twilio had to connect through that to the Zero</li>
<li>I initially setup a simple port forward to the Zero and I already use <a href="http://no-IP.com">no-IP.com</a> for Dynamic DNS. So Twilio called <a href="http://something.no-ip.net:1234">http://something.no-ip.net:1234</a> and my router passed the request to the PiZero server app on port blah</li>
<li>The PiZero server app parsed the POST request and extracted out the SMS. It split this into multiple Tweets (a la Tweetstorm) if more than 140 chars and used the <a href="https://github.com/ChimeraCoder/anaconda">Anaconda Go client library</a> to post that to @BandonFEWS on Twitter</li>
<li>Done</li>
</ul>

<p>But I wasn&rsquo;t happy with http, nooooo, I wanted https and I wanted to use <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let&rsquo;s Encrypt</a>. Cue rabbit hole.</p>

<h2 id="let-s-encrypt-and-caddy:e19abcb8e6b6d101fc1a316dfdf4aa74">Let&rsquo;s Encrypt and Caddy</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s Encrypt offers free https certs.</p>

<p><em>It&rsquo;s as revolutionary as the PiZero.</em></p>

<p>It also provides APIs so this can be done completely automatically. This resulted in lots of people adding easy Let&rsquo;s Encrypt integration and client libraries very quickly.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://caddyserver.com/">Caddy</a> is a really nice simple-to-use web-server written in Go. It runs perfectly on the PiZero. It also has completely automatic Let&rsquo;s Encrypt integration if you want it. So I stuck it in front of my Go server to turn it into a https server. Except life is never that easy.</li>
<li>I hit two immediate problems:

<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;d have to drop no-IP for Dynamic DNS since I&rsquo;m trying to register for my own https cert</li>
<li>To stop baddies registering domains they don&rsquo;t own, Let&rsquo;s Encrypt calls back to you and insists on doing that on port 443. So my random high port number on my router wasn&rsquo;t going to work</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Then I realised that my DNS provider, <a href="http://www.dnsmadeeasy.com/">DNSMadeEasy</a> has Dynamic DNS built-in. So I grabbed one of my parked domains and set it up with a Dynamic DNS A Record, giving it a dedicated password. But then of course I discovered that my Asus Router doesn&rsquo;t have support for Custom Dynamic DNS out of the box.</li>
<li>I quickly found the <a href="http://asuswrt.lostrealm.ca/">Merlin Firmware</a> which is interesting. The standard Asus firmware is just a simplified fork of <a href="http://www.polarcloud.com/tomato">Tomato</a> so Merlin forks again and adds back in the stuff that Asus removed. So you keep the same UI and general functionality, just with more customisation.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/RMerl/asuswrt-merlin/wiki/Installation">Installation was a doddle</a> and then I just had to whip up a simple script a few lines long to call out to DNSMadeEasy whenever the router&rsquo;s IP address changed (see below).</li>
<li>I then temporarily port forwarded 443 on the router to the Pi Zero and started Caddy with this incredibly complicated config file :-)</li>
</ul>

<p>Caddyfile:</p>

<pre><code>file
https://www.conorsdomain.com
proxy / localhost:9998
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Caddy saw that I wanted https, so it connected to Let&rsquo;s Encrypt and a minute later I had everything necessary for my secure web-server.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Jaw-drop time</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Once the registration was done I could remove the 443 port forward and switch to a non-standard port</li>
<li>I went over to Twilio and provided the new <a href="https://conorsdomain.com:9999">https://conorsdomain.com:9999</a> as the end-point to call. No joy. But a quick support ticket later and they made a change over the weekend(!) to fix it. Boom, everything working fine.</li>
<li>With the terrible weather, I didn&rsquo;t have to wait long for the first non-test SMS to appear. A couple of seconds later it was on Twitter:</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/flood_alert.jpg" alt="Bandon Flood Warning" /></p>

<h2 id="alternatives:e19abcb8e6b6d101fc1a316dfdf4aa74">Alternatives</h2>

<ul>
<li>Of course I could exclude Twilio from this entire flow and call the end-point directly from Tasker but SMS will often work when no data connection is available.</li>
<li>Having said that, the connection to the phone is a big worry as we are in a poor signal area. But registering my UK Twilio number on the Flood Warning site didn&rsquo;t work (local warnings for local people) and I&rsquo;m not paying $6 a month for an Irish number.</li>
<li>In theory I could take the scraped data from the site and generate my own alerts but the Council rightly overrides the default trigger levels on occasion to warn people of impending flooding.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is smidge fiddly. <a href="https://github.com/RMerl/asuswrt-merlin/wiki/Custom-DDNS">More details here</a>. Once you have Merlin installed and you are happily connected to the internet again (you did remember to write down all the settings for your ISP didn&rsquo;t you?). You need to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Go to Administration -&gt; System</li>
<li>Enable SSH, which also obviously gives you SFTP</li>
<li>Toggle &ldquo;Format JFFS partition at next boot&rdquo; to Yes</li>
<li>Toggle &ldquo;Enable JFFS custom scripts and configs&rdquo; to Yes</li>
<li>Click Apply</li>
<li>SSH on to the box with your router&rsquo;s Admin username and password</li>
<li>Create a file called /jffs/scripts/ddns-start</li>
<li>Make it executable (chmod 755 ddns-start)</li>
<li>Copy these contents into ddns-start</li>
</ul>

<pre><code class="language-bash">#!/bin/sh

                    <div class="post-description">
                        <p>I switched this blog to the superb Go-based tool <a href="https://gohugo.io/overview/usage/">Hugo</a> earlier in the year. Its staggering speed compared to HarpJS and Hexo plus a single executable you can drop in anywhere, make it a no-brainer for static blogs.</p>

<p>I continued to host for free on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> which means I never ever ever have to worry about WordPress security exploits or badly written plugins again. However using GH Pages means you are quite limited in how things work.</p>

<p>For several months I used Hugo in the recommended way of having <a href="https://github.com/conoro/hugo.conoroneill.net">one Git repo</a> for the blog&rsquo;s &ldquo;source files&rdquo; and then the original <a href="https://github.com/conoro/conoro.github.io">conoro.github.io repo</a> as a Git sub-module for the deployed HTML. I&rsquo;ve never heard a good word said about Git sub-modules and now I understand why. Nasty awkward things that mess everything up if you blink wrong. But it worked ok-ish until I decided to try <a href="https://travis-ci.org">Travis CI</a>.</p>

<p>Travis is a continuous integration tool that can watch for changes in your GitHub repos and then run &ldquo;jobs&rdquo; on them. It&rsquo;s mainly used for building software but there is no reason you can&rsquo;t use it for building a blog. So the initial idea was that I would git add/commit a new blog post in my source repo and then Travis would run Hugo on it and commit the generated HTML to the blog, thereby publishing it.</p>

<p>The real intent was so I could blog from devices that don&rsquo;t run Hugo like phones and tablets. Of course they&rsquo;d somehow need to support a text editor and Git but not Hugo itself.</p>

<p>For Android I quickly found the superb <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aor.droidedit.pro&amp;hl=en">DroidEdit</a> which has Git support built-in. It was dead easy to use it to generate a new post and add that to my repo. So I would have almost WordPress-level of easiness in blogging on the fly. Its only real drawback is the lack of Markdown syntax highlighting.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/droidedit.png" alt="DroidEdit" /></p>

<p>Except then I tried to get it working with Travis. Several weekends of effort trying to wrangle the Git sub-module setup into submission ended in total frustration. Finally today I said &ldquo;sod sub-modules&rdquo; and went old-school &ldquo;copy the files from one repo to the other and commit them there&rdquo;. And ye know what? <a href="https://travis-ci.org/conoro/hugo.conoroneill.net">It worked</a>!</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a few bits in there to do with using https:// instead of git://. But the critical one-off steps on your PC are:</p>

<ol>
<li>get a <a href="https://github.com/settings/applications">Github token</a> for Travis</li>
<li>Then <a href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/encryption-keys/">install Travis locally</a></li>
<li>and encrypt your token via:
<code>bash
travis encrypt GH_TOKEN=&lt;secret token here&gt;  
</code></li>
<li>Finally add that output to the &ldquo;secure&rdquo; string in .travis.yml.</li>
</ol>

<p>So here you go with the files you need to do the same:</p>

<p>.travis.yml</p>

                        <p>One mistake I made with our <a href="http://conoroneill.net/all-the-tech-behind-our-halloween-hallway-of-horror/">Halloween setup</a> was buying an analogue RGB LED strip where all the LEDs had to be set to the same colour. Then a few weeks ago, <a href="https://twitter.com/joedesbonnet">Joe Desbonnet</a> Facebooked about getting a waterproof WS2812 strip with individual LED control. And it wasn&rsquo;t that much more expensive than the analogue one. Off to eBay I went <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/141757617308?_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649&amp;var=440868603421&amp;ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT">and ordered one</a>, far too late for Christmas.</p>

<p>So I was chuffed that it arrived on Christmas Eve. Unfortunately the 8 amp PSU I ordered on Aliexpress didn&rsquo;t arrive. A quick rustle in my psu drawer found a 4 amp one. Another quick rustle in another box found an old <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardNano">Arduino Nano</a> and it took barely 5 mins to load it up with the <a href="https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel/blob/master/examples/strandtest/strandtest.ino">Adafruit strand test code</a> and wire everything together (one digital pin, gnd, 5v) to give this:</p>

<p><iframe src="https://vine.co/v/iAaKnlhxXWX/embed/simple" width="600" height="600" frameborder="0"></iframe><script src="https://platform.vine.co/static/scripts/embed.js"></script></p>

<p>The psu was running warm but not crazily so. However the Arduino kept crashing which hinted that the psu was dropping below 5V to power all those LEDs. So I ran separate power to the Arduino from a phone charger.</p>

<p>This was followed by 4km of duct tape as the connections and Arduino would have to live outside. A gale was blowing as I tried to attach it to the window frame so I switched to the more sheltered door frame. This <a href="http://www.everbuild.co.uk/index.php?route=product/product&amp;product_id=364">Mammoth tape</a> worked <em>really</em> well:</p>

</div>

<p>And that was it. Almost zero effort for the best house light decoration we&rsquo;ve ever done. Since these strips can be cut to any length you want and also spliced together, I&rsquo;ll be fashioning a full house-length monstrosity for next Christmas. However I doubt I&rsquo;ll ever reach this level:</p>

<p>I did a splurge of backing IoT KickStarters a few months ago and the <a href="https://onion.io/omega/">Onion Omega</a> is the first one to land in my postbox. It&rsquo;s a tiny (barely bigger than an SD card) board running the same basic guts as many OpenWRT routers i.e. 400 MHz Atheros MIPS CPU with 64MB of DRAM and 16MB of Flash.</p>

<p><img src="http://conoroneill.net.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/omega_sd.jpg" alt="Onion Omega" /></p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re not familiar with <a href="https://openwrt.org/">OpenWRT</a>, it&rsquo;s an Open Source community replacement firmware for many routers (similar to DD-WRT that I&rsquo;ve used many times) and is Linux under the hood. You generally do your own custom Firmware builds which bundle exactly what you want but you can also install packages via the opkg tool.</p>

<p>Obviously 400MHz with tiny RAM cannot compete with an RPi but it is far more powerful than most MCUs and runs Linux. The question is whether this middle ground addresses a big enough market, particularly when the price point is almost the same as an RPi Model A and you need to buy add-on cards to work easily with it. I&rsquo;m not sure yet.</p>

<p>The Onion team are currently building a Web UI and an IoT &ldquo;Cloud&rdquo; as value-adds and of course everything is OpenSource.</p>

<p>The fact that it just launched means that the software story isn&rsquo;t great right now. The KickStarter mentions things like Node but that isn&rsquo;t available in a supported way. Also the effort around accessing GPIOs etc is focused on Python. And add-on boards like the OLED screen I bought have no support yet.</p>

<p><img src="http://conoroneill.net.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/omega_kit.jpg" alt="Onion Omega Kit" /></p>

<h2 id="summary-opinion:6373a9f13467451d12a87cf58bb7873b">Summary Opinion</h2>

<p>Overall it&rsquo;s a nice board but the lack of &ldquo;buzz&rdquo; around it has me a little worried. The number one thing that projects like this need is community. I think the CHiP might steal a lot of its thunder with more welly at a much lower pricepoint. But perhaps a focus on realtime embedded applications will help here.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to see a library like WiringPi built for it that can easily have wrappers for others languages implemented.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;ll be ideal as a home API server that I can put anywhere and forget about.</p>

<p>Another area it could shine, due to its tiny size and low power consumption is robotics. See my comment below about <a href="http://gobot.io/">Gobot</a>.</p>

<h2 id="node-js-partial-success:6373a9f13467451d12a87cf58bb7873b">Node.js partial success</h2>

<p>After an initial play around with it, I decided to try out Node and Go. Node was <a href="https://community.onion.io/topic/46/simple-node-js-wrapper-samples">built by a community member</a> but is back on version 0.10.5.</p>

<p>I copied the Node executable and libv8 to a USB stick and plugged that into the Onion standard &ldquo;dock&rdquo;. I mounted it and ran hello world successfully. Hurrah!</p>

<p>But then I realised it doesn&rsquo;t have NPM. So I put together a simple Tweeting App, did the NPM install on my Fedora VM and then copied everything to the USB stick.</p>

<p>The code which ran fine on Fedora crapped out with &ldquo;not authenticated&rdquo; on the Onion. I tried two other Twitter modules with the same result. I wasn&rsquo;t able to see any other error apart from Twitter complaining about authentication.</p>

<p>So I gave up on Node for the moment.</p>

<h2 id="golang-1-1-2-first-failed-attempt:6373a9f13467451d12a87cf58bb7873b">Golang 1.1.2 first failed attempt</h2>

<p>On to Go and a giant big rabbit hole.</p>

<p>So you can&rsquo;t get a recent version of Go for MIPS. However, one smart person <a href="https://github.com/GeertJohan/openwrt-go">forked OpenWRT and added Go support</a> via <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccgo/Invoking-gccgo.html">gccgo</a>. Yay it&rsquo;s Go, boo it&rsquo;s Go 1.1.2.</p>

<p>But I thought it&rsquo;d be a good experience to try building OpenWRT from scratch anyway. The <a href="https://github.com/GeertJohan/openwrt-go/issues/2">instructions here</a> and <a href="http://www.sajalkayan.com/post/golang-openwrt-mips.html">here</a> are pretty straightforward and I managed to build the Gnu cross-compile toolchain inside a Fedora 22 VM on Windows 10.</p>

<p>NOTE: DO NOT DO THE FOLLOWING. IT DIDN&rsquo;T WORK. FOLLOW THE STEPS LATER FOR CLEAN NEW OPENWRT</p>

<pre><code>git clone git@github.com:GeertJohan/openwrt-go.git openwrt
cd openwrt
./scripts/feeds update -a
./scripts/feeds install -a
cp ~/Desktop/scons-2.3.5.tar.gz dl (needed to download this manually as it was missing)
cp ~/Desktop/openssl-1.0.2c.tar.gz dl (needed to download this manually as it was missing)
make menuconfig
</code></pre>

<p>In menuconfig you have to enable a few things:</p>

<ul>
<li>-&gt; Advanced configuration options</li>
<li>&ndash;&gt; Toolchain options</li>
<li>&mdash;&gt; C library implementation</li>
<li>&mdash;-&gt; Use eglibc</li>
<li>-&gt; Advanced configuration options</li>
<li>&ndash;&gt; Toolchain options</li>
<li>&mdash;&gt; Select Build/Install gccgo</li>
</ul>

<p>Then save and exit, followed by:</p>

<pre><code>make
</code></pre>

<p>Several hours later on my old i7 laptop, I had everything I needed.</p>

<p>Then a simple helloworld Web Server helloweb.go that only uses standard library features:</p>

<pre><code>package main

import (
    &quot;fmt&quot;
    &quot;net/http&quot;
)

func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    fmt.Fprintf(w, &quot;Hi there, I love %s!&quot;, r.URL.Path[1:])
}

func main() {
    http.HandleFunc(&quot;/&quot;, handler)
    http.ListenAndServe(&quot;:8080&quot;, nil)
}
</code></pre>

<p>Create ~/openwrt.config which consists of</p>

<pre><code>export STAGING_DIR=/home/conor/openwrt/staging_dir 
export TOOLCHAIN_DIR=$STAGING_DIR/toolchain-mips_34kc_gcc-4.8-linaro_glibc-2.19 
export LDCFLAGS=$TOOLCHAIN_DIR/usr/lib 
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$TOOLCHAIN_DIR/usr/lib 
export PATH=$TOOLCHAIN_DIR/bin:$PATH
</code></pre>

<p>Then build it:</p>

<pre><code>. ~/openwrt.config
mips_gccgo -Wall -o helloweb_static_libgo helloweb.go -static-libgo
</code></pre>

<p>I copied it over to the Onion but no joy. It just kept saying &ldquo;not found&rdquo;. Distant memories told me this was related to libraries and versions but nothing I tried worked. So I took a break.</p>

<h2 id="golang-1-1-2-second-successful-attempt:6373a9f13467451d12a87cf58bb7873b">Golang 1.1.2 second successful attempt</h2>

<p>A while later I decided that what I needed to do was build OpenWRT for the Onion but then I hit a blocker. Onion support was added to OpenWRT in July but the latest version of the toolchain that included Go was from May. So I bit the bullet and manually &ldquo;cherry-picked&rdquo; <a href="https://github.com/GeertJohan/openwrt-go/commits/add-gccgo-and-libgo?author=GeertJohan">all of the author&rsquo;s changes</a> from the older toolchain into the latest version of OpenWRT.</p>

<p>You can get <a href="https://gist.github.com/conoro/887362ebdbbada2cfbc6">the patchfile I generated here</a> and apply it.</p>

<p>NOTE: THESE STEPS WORK OK.</p>

<p>Now to build from scratch again:</p>

<pre><code>sudo dnf install -y subversion binutils bzip2 gcc gcc-c++ gawk gettext flex ncurses-devel zlib-devel zlib-static make patch unzip perl-ExtUtils-MakeMaker glibc glibc-devel glibc-static quilt sed sdcc intltool sharutils bison wget

. ~/openwrt.config   (see the contents of that file in the first failed attempt)

rm -rf ~/openwrt
git clone git://git.openwrt.org/openwrt.git openwrt
cd openwrt
</code></pre>

<pre><code>nano feeds.conf.default
</code></pre>

<p>and append the following:</p>

<pre><code>src-git onion https://github.com/OnionIoT/OpenWRT-Packages.git
</code></pre>

<p>Then:</p>

<pre><code>scripts/feeds update -a

make menuconfig
</code></pre>

<p>Note you have to include the same menuconfig settings as before i.e.</p>

<ul>
<li>-&gt; Advanced configuration options</li>
<li>&ndash;&gt; Toolchain options</li>
<li>&mdash;&gt; C library implementation</li>
<li>&mdash;-&gt; Use eglibc</li>
<li>-&gt; Advanced configuration options</li>
<li>&ndash;&gt; Toolchain options</li>
<li>&mdash;&gt; Select Build/Install gccgo</li>
</ul>

<p>Plus the following for both the Onion and USB stick. This uses <a href="https://github.com/OnionIoT/OpenWRT-Packages/wiki/Setting-Up-the-Cross-Compile-Environment">some instructions from the Onion site</a>:</p>

<ol>
<li>Target System is Atheros AR7xxx/AR9xxx</li>
<li>Subtarget is Generic</li>
<li>Target Profile is Onion Omega</li>
<li>Target Images is squashfs</li>
<li>Add kmod-fs-vfat</li>
<li>Add kmod-nls-cp437</li>
</ol>

<pre><code>make
</code></pre>

<p>Several hours later again, I finally had <a href="http://conoroneill.net.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-onion-omega-squashfs-factory.bin">a version of the firmware that included Go support</a> and ran on the Onion by doing the following on the Onion:</p>

<pre><code>cd /tmp
scp conor@192.168.0.9:/mnt/disk2/software/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-onion-omega-squashfs-factory.bin .
sysupgrade openwrt-ar71xx-generic-onion-omega-squashfs-factory.bin 
</code></pre>

<h2 id="hello-world-web-server-in-go-on-the-onion-omega:6373a9f13467451d12a87cf58bb7873b">Hello World Web Server in Go on the Onion Omega</h2>

<p>Back to helloworld on the Fedora 22 VM:</p>

<pre><code>alias mips_gccgo='mips-openwrt-linux-gccgo -Wl,-R,/home/conor/openwrt/staging_dir/toolchain-mips_34kc_gcc-4.8-linaro_glibc-2.19/lib/gcc/mips-openwrt-linux-gnu/4.8.3 -L /home/conor/openwrt/staging_dir/toolchain-mips_34kc_gcc-4.8.0-linaro_glibc-2.19/lib'

mips_gccgo -Wall -o helloweb_static_libgo helloweb.go -static-libgo
</code></pre>

<p>Copy to the Onion and run it with a simple ./helloweb_static_libgo</p>

<p>Hurrah, Hello World in Go on the Onion!</p>

<p><img src="http://conoroneill.net.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/go_on_onion_omega_02.jpg" alt="I love mac and cheese" /></p>

<h2 id="tweeting-from-the-onion-omega-in-go:6373a9f13467451d12a87cf58bb7873b">Tweeting from the Onion Omega in Go</h2>

<p>I should have left it at that but no, I wanted to Tweet from the Onion. My problems multiplied. Basically, gccgo doesn&rsquo;t have all the bells and whistles of recent Go and can&rsquo;t handle included packages easily. After some reading and playing, I managed to build a Tweeting App that used the <a href="https://github.com/kurrik/twittergo">Twittergo package</a>. Note you need a local Fedora version of <a href="https://golang.org/dl/">Go installed and configured</a> for &ldquo;go get&rdquo; to work (or just git clone). My $GOPATH is /home/conor/gitwork/go</p>

<p>I used the <a href="https://github.com/kurrik/twittergo-examples/blob/master/tweet/main.go">example from Twittergo</a> to send the tweet, with the same mods to remove paths from the imports as the other files.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">. ~/openwrt.config

cd ~/gitwork/go/src/github.com
go get github.com/kurrik/twittergo
go get github.com/kurrik/oauth1a
go get github.com/kurrik/json
cd kurrik/json
mips-openwrt-linux-gccgo -c json.go
cd ../oauth1a
mips-openwrt-linux-gccgo -c oauth1a.go userconfig.go
cd ../twittergo
cp ../json/json.o .
cp ../oauth1a/oauth1a.o .
emacs twittergo.go  (change github.com/kurrik/oauth1a to oauth1a)
emacs models.go  (change github.com/kurrik/json to json)
mips-openwrt-linux-gccgo -c twittergo.go models.go
emacs tweetomega.go
mips_gccgo -Wall -o tweetomega main.go -static-libgo json.o  oauth1a.o twittergo.o
gedit CREDENTIALS
</code></pre>

<p>I was nearly there. The code ran but threw an error almost immediately about x509 root certs being missing. I ran all of the following, which seemed to fix it (but I&rsquo;m not sure if all needed):</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">opkg update
opkg install ca-certificates
opkg install openssl-util
opkg install curl
wget http://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem
mv cacert.pem /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
scp conor@192.168.0.9:/mnt/disk2/software/CREDENTIALS .
scp conor@192.168.0.9:/mnt/disk2/software/tweetomega .
./tweetomega
</code></pre>

<p>And finally ta-daaaa, a Tweet from the Omega:</p>

<p><img src="http://conoroneill.net.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hushvine_onion_01.jpg" alt="Tweetin Omega" /></p>

<p>I now suspect that the Node.js error may have been exactly the same thing but just hidden so I&rsquo;ll go back and try the same for it.</p>

<h2 id="final-notes:6373a9f13467451d12a87cf58bb7873b">Final notes</h2>

<ol>
<li>That custom firmware I built is missing all of the Onion&rsquo;s own stuff and I&rsquo;m not sure how to add that. However you can easily re-install the latest factory Onion image by wgetting it using the URL you find <a href="http://cloud.onion.io/api/firmware/stable.json">in this file</a> into /tmp using sysupgrade name_of_image.</li>
<li>We really need Go 1.6 to support MIPS. I think the Onion is a great device for running Go. We might even get <a href="http://gobot.io/">Gobots</a> running.</li>

<p>Despite starting weeks earlier than usual, Halloween still involved a day of last minute panic to bring everything together. The end result was this:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FClhSNwFfT0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>The basic setup was an update of ideas from previous years and consisted of the following.</p>

<h2 id="3d-printed-mummy-in-coffin-doorbell:308bcb7036a2d3eb810a4711be2b8022">3D-printed Mummy in Coffin Doorbell</h2>

<p>This was my favourite aspect of the whole thing. I spotted a <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:32905">cool 3D design on Thingiverse</a> and realised I could turn it into a doorbell by dremeling a hole in the back and hot-glueing the mummy to a simple push button.</p>

<p><img src="http://conoroneill.net.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/mummy01b.jpg" alt="Mummy Doorbell 1" /></p>

<p>In fact the button was one I originally bought in 2012 when I got back into electronics. There was a small bug in my debounce code which I discovered too late and meant that kids had to press the button twice. But overall only a few failed to figure it out.</p>

<p>I had intended everything to be Arduino and ESP8266 (running Arduino code) only so I needed some way of playing the scream. In previous years <a href="http://conoroneill.net/the-raspberrypi-doorbell-of-dooooooooommmmmmmm/">I used a Raspberry Pi</a> (successfully) and <a href="http://conoroneill.net/a-tech-halloween-mainly-made-of-fail/">a really crappy device</a> (less successfully).</p>

<p>In a bizarre twist to the <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/be-maker-kit-plus-free-lessons-on-electronics-from-zero-to-internet-of-things">BE Maker Kit Indiegogo scam</a>, one of the people involved somehow got a Florida company to provide free electronics to the right amount. I used this to buy the <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/products/1381">Adafruit VS1053 Audio board</a> and <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/987">Adafruit MAX98306 Audio Amp</a>. The wiring on this looks complicated but it&rsquo;s straight out of their tutorial.</p>

<p>The Arduino Nano for this was the &ldquo;Master&rdquo; device. It detected the doorbell press and then started playing the file on the SD card and sent a high signal both to the Banana Pi for the LED strip and the Arduino Uno for the relays controlling the skull. It&rsquo;s basically the Adafruit demo VS1053 code with a few extra lines added by me. The code for that <a href="https://gist.github.com/conoro/58a028f7399b4e50619e">is here on Gist</a>.</p>

<p>I finally ordered a bog-standard <a href="http://eud.dx.com/product/waterproof-72w-4300lm-300-5050-smd-led-rgb-light-flexible-strip-w-44-key-controller-844233947">5 metre 5050 RGB LED strip from dx.com</a> over the summer. The value on these things is just staggering at less than €20.</p>

<p><img src="http://conoroneill.net.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/sku_233947_1.jpg" alt="RGB LED" /></p>

<p>They come with a dedicated remote control and just need a decent PSU to provide the power. Myself and the kids had great fun illuminating my entire home office in a range of colours.</p>

<p>But the challenge for Halloween was how to control it. I could have run <a href="http://www.lirc.org/html/irrecord.html">irrecord</a> on an <a href="http://www.hardkernel.com/main/products/prdt_info.php?g_code=G141578608433">ODROID C1</a> or <a href="http://www.bananapi.org/p/product.html">Banana Pi</a> to reverse engineer the remote control protocol and then use <a href="http://eud.dx.com/product/38khz-ir-infrared-transmitter-module-for-arduino-844135040">the RC transmitter</a> I bought on DX. But luckily someone <a href="http://hackaday.com/2015/08/25/esp8266-in-commercial-products/">told Hackaday about the first ESP8266-powered commercial product</a> they had found. It was a <a href="http://es.aliexpress.com/item/rgb-strip-WiFi-controller-1-port-control-15-rgb-lights-communicate-with-Android-phone-to-dim/32301423622.html">€9 Wifi H801 control module</a> for RGB LED strips! I just had to get one.</p>

<p><img src="http://conoroneill.net.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Rgbww-tira-llevada-regulador-wifi-1-port-control-200-luces-comunicar-con-tel%C3%A9fono-Android-a-trav%C3%A9s.jpg_350x350.jpg" alt="Wifi RGB LED" /></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a brilliant little box that is easy to wire up and has a simple Android App for control. You connect to the internal Wifi Access Point it provides to do this. Here is the brilliant piece: You then use the app to tell the module to connect to your own Wifi router and then you do the same with the phone. Now your RGB LED strip is on your network!</p>

<p>But it gets better. A very smart person <a href="https://www.domoticz.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=38&amp;t=7957">reverse-engineered the basic over-the-air protocol</a> that the app uses to control the Wifi module. Unfortunately he was using a slightly different module to me and it didn&rsquo;t work. I then spent a week of evenings learning all about <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/">Wireshark</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netcat">Netcat</a>. I was able to do the same as him and find the basic UDP control protocol (only minor difference in the packets)</p>

<p>In summary:</p>

<ul>
<li>OFF: \xfb\xeb\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x9f\x97\x9d\x00</li>
<li>RED: \xfb\xeb\xff\x00\x00\x00\x00\x9f\x97\x9d\x00</li>
<li>GREEN: \xfb\xeb\x00\xff\x00\x00\x00\x9f\x97\x9d\x00</li>
<li>BLUE: \xfb\xeb\x00\x00\xff\x00\x00\x9f\x97\x9d\x00</li>
</ul>

<p>My plan was to use a <a href="http://nodemcu.com/index_en.html">NodeMCU ESP8266 module</a> to send the relevant commands, using either NodeMCU LUA or the <a href="https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino">Arduino port to ESP8266</a> but I ran out of time to experiment.</p>

<p>So I had Netcat working happily on the Banana Pi running Fedora but I also needed to be able to use the GPIO pins to tell the BPi when to turn on/off the LED strip. I then made the classic mistake of panicking on Halloween morning and switching to the RaspberryPi so I could use <a href="http://wiringpi.com/">WiringPi</a> for GPIO. Except the Netcat commands hung on the RPi (still no idea why).</p>

<p>Some Googling revealed that WiringPi had been <a href="https://github.com/LeMaker/WiringBP">ported to Raspbian on the BPi</a> so I tried that. Same Netcat problem! So I took a chance and re-inserted the Fedora SD card and downloaded the BPi version of WiringPi. Result! It compiled and ran perfectly.</p>

<p>The I moved on to several hours of trying to write a Bash script to monitor a GPIO pin using WiringPi and control the RGB LED strip with echo/netcat. All I will say about that is I am never ever writing a Bash script again (space-sensitive around brackets/equals for the love of god). This is the final result and, to be fair, it worked seamlessly:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">
#!/bin/bash
sets=`/usr/local/bin/gpio mode 7 down`
setit=$sets
state=&quot;low&quot;
echo -e '\xfb\xeb\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x9f\x97\x9d\x00' | nc -v -u 192.168.0.128 30977
sleep 1
while :
do
    pins=`/usr/local/bin/gpio read 7`
    if [ $pins = &quot;1&quot; ]; then
        if [ $state = &quot;low&quot; ]; then
            echo -e '\xfb\xeb\xff\x00\x00\x00\x00\x9f\x97\x9d\x00' | nc -v -u 192.168.0.128 30977
            state=&quot;high&quot;
            echo high 
        fi
    else
        if [ $state = &quot;high&quot; ]; then
           echo -e '\xfb\xeb\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x9f\x97\x9d\x00' | nc -v -u 192.168.0.128 30977
           state=&quot;low&quot;
           echo low
        fi
    fi
done

</code></pre>

<p>But I was so horrified by Bash, I did a quick and dirty re-write <a href="https://gist.github.com/conoro/935e0fa3acc90d066b9a">to Go this morning</a>. It uses the <a href="https://github.com/hugozhu/rpi">Golang bindings to WiringPi</a> and seems to work very well.</p>

<p>So the strip was now sorted. On to the rotating skull.</p>

<h2 id="an-anatomically-correct-skull-with-scary-eyes:308bcb7036a2d3eb810a4711be2b8022">An anatomically correct skull with scary eyes</h2>

<p>The skull idea came from a wonderful <a href="http://www.tested.com/art/makers/530668-how-make-realistic-horror-skull-prop/">tested.com video</a> where special effects artist Frank Ippolito bought a cheap skull on Amazon and then used latex, cotton wool and paint to turn it into a horrific burn-victim thing.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v8w4hufoujg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>I thought we could do the same and found a skull on Amazon UK. It arrived and looked great apart from the lack of a movable jaw. But it then sat there for months with no progress due to me being artistically challenged.</p>

<p>As an alternative I thought about doing something with eyes so I got some half-eyes from Amazon too They were a smidge small but fit for purpose. I grabbed some of my old tiny micro-servos which I have never found a use for and hot-glued the eyes to them. A bit of messing with the range of movement and I had a vaguely spooky setup.</p>

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EagDgNoEpTc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>But the fact that you could see the servos and they move pretty slowly meant I was a bit disappointed. I tried to vamp them up a bit more by adding neopixel ring but it was too big so I switched to a single funky Adafruit RGB neopixel on each one. So now I had 6 wires coming out of each eye.</p>

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/30LBjo5oG3I" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Finally on Saturday morning I went to finish this bit and decided it was too much work to get the Arduino code tweaked to do 2x Neopixels and 2x servos and somehow trigger them on/off on a potentially rotating head. At this point I found the silly fake-eye pingpong balls from last year. A quick cut in the back and I hot-glued a Neopixel to each one. I then hot-glued the eyes into the skull and wired the Neopixels to an Arduino Nano.</p>

<p><img src="http://conoroneill.net.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/skull_top.jpg" alt="Skull Arduino" /></p>

<p>I stuck the Nano and a Lipo battery to the top of the skull and covered it with a cool Buff. Having the eyes on permanently removed a little bit of the element of surprise but I still thought it worked well. The code for the Neopixels was just the <a href="https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel/blob/master/examples/strandtest/strandtest.ino">standard Adafruit strand test</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://conoroneill.net.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/buff_skull.jpg" alt="Buff Skull" /></p>

<h2 id="making-the-skull-rotate:308bcb7036a2d3eb810a4711be2b8022">Making the skull rotate</h2>

<p>I had always known I would rotate the skull in some fashion but for a while I wasn&rsquo;t sure how. Quite a few weeks ago I came up with the idea to cement a hex driver into the bottom of the skull and sit it on top of a cheap crap €20 electric screwdriver I got ages ago from Woodies.</p>

<p><img src="http://conoroneill.net.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/screwdriver1.jpg" alt="Screwdriver1" /></p>

<p>As a screwdriver it was rubbish due to slowness and lack of torque. As a skull-rotator it was awesome, spinning the skull around at high speed.</p>

<p><img src="http://conoroneill.net.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/screwdriver2.jpg" alt="Screwdriver2" /></p>

<p>Of course I left the difficult bits until a week before Halloween when I sat down and tried to figure out how to control it all. The first attempt was with a dirt cheap double relay board I got 3 years ago and never used. But I couldn&rsquo;t figure out how to make it go forwards and reverse. I then tried an old knock-off Adafruit Motor Shield but it couldn&rsquo;t deliver enough juice (even with a 7.2V LiPo) to overcome the motor&rsquo;s inertia. Finally I <a href="http://arduino-info.wikispaces.com/ArduinoPower">found a relay circuit</a> that did forward/reverse and it worked like a charm.</p>

<p><img src="http://conoroneill.net.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/DC_Motor_2SPDT_Relay-450.jpg" alt="Circuit" /></p>

<p><img src="http://conoroneill.net.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/relay2.jpg" alt="Relay" /></p>

<p>But how was I going to handle starting/stopping the skull so it was facing away (and potentially covered) initially and then rotating at the right time and stopping in the right position? Of course I left that to Halloween itself.</p>

<p>I used polystyrene and duct tape to brace the screwdriver. Then I setup two limit switches. I then applied power. The head spun around and ripped the switches off their mounts. Damn. So another quick executive decision was made. The head would start rotating when the doorbell was pressed and then stop after 10-15 seconds. Which meant some kids would get the full scary effect whilst others would see the flashing eyes before they got to the door.</p>

<h2 id="tying-it-all-together:308bcb7036a2d3eb810a4711be2b8022">Tying it all together</h2>

<p>This turned out to be pretty easy. I have a ton of decent wire from a dead Christmas tree light string and used that to connect everything up. The doorbell connected to one Arudino which then toggled a pin which the other Arduinos were connected to. After N seconds, it toggled the pin the other way to shut it all down.</p>

<p><img src="http://conoroneill.net.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/wiring.jpg" alt="Wiring" /></p>

<p>It worked very very well.</p>

<h2 id="next-year:308bcb7036a2d3eb810a4711be2b8022">Next year?</h2>

<p>Hmm not sure. I wanted to do something with ghosts flying down zip wires a few years ago but I just didn&rsquo;t have the knowhow. I&rsquo;m feeling a lot more confident about that now.</p>

                        <p>AWS is now an $8Bn business for Amazon. Could anyone have predicted that in 1997 or even 2007? This week I was talking to a few people about who might be able to disrupt AWS. It won&rsquo;t be easy. We immediately discounted the old guys like HP, IBM, Dell etc and even Google seems to be a complete also-ran in IaaS. Microsoft Azure might have potential.</p>

<p>PaaS is separate as it&rsquo;s higher up the stack and makes use of IaaS. I expect Open Source PaaS like <a href="http://www.openshift.com/">OpenShift 3</a> to grow very quickly in the coming years as it makes deployment and management of Apps incredibly easy. Where PaaS might hurt AWS is in abstracting what IaaS you are using, so as long as the feature set is there, you don&rsquo;t care where your Apps are running (apart from Geo lag and data protection laws).</p>

<p>One of the people I talked to thinks that AWS will be slayed by a startup who may not even exist yet. He also felt that smart VPSes like <a href="http://www.digitalocean.com">DigitalOcean</a> might do it. I&rsquo;m a huge fan of DO and gained enormous reliability and speed by switching to it from Google Compute Engine/CloudSQL whilst reducing my bill by 2/3rds. But it still feels like an SME/SMB or individual developer solution.</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;m predicting it&rsquo;ll be Facebook. Why? Think about the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>They understand building things at massive scale on a global basis</li>
<li>They build their <a href="http://www.thejournal.ie/facebook-building-data-centre-in-meath-2161944-Jun2015/">own datacenters</a></li>
<li>They built the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/sep/25/facebook-datacentre-lulea-sweden-node-pole">most energy efficient computing facility</a> ever</li>
<li>They created the <a href="http://www.opencompute.org/">Open Compute</a> project</li>
<li>They have incubated some <a href="https://github.com/facebook">incredible Open Source projects</a> like <a href="http://cassandra.apache.org/">Cassandra</a> and <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a></li>
<li>They use PHP. Forget I mentioned that ;-)</li>
<li>They understand that <a href="http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2015/6/19/presentation-mobile-is-eating-the-world">mobile is eating the world</a> and they own <a href="https://parse.com/">Parse</a></li>
<li>They understand real-time messaging <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/">at massive scale</a></li>
<li>They could do this in their sleep</li>
</ul>

<p>The big open question is how they do their virtualisation and containerisation. If they have that nailed, then I think they might go for it.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s re-visit this post in 5 years.</p>

<p>As an old Embedded guy who actually cares about resource usage, I&rsquo;ve been bothered for quite a while by the number of trivial Node.js projects out there that require a full-blown MongoDB or MySQL server to operate. It&rsquo;s a particular problem on the Raspberry Pi or small <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">DigitalOcean</a> Droplets. In many cases a simple SQLite DB or TingoDB is more than sufficient.</p>

<p>If your Web App has 2 registered users and 100 visitors per day, may just maybe you don&rsquo;t need MongoDB or MySQL. I have a set of small Node.js projects now where I use the following combinations and they all work well. Anything you are doing in-house on a Raspberry Pi should absolutely use one of these. In fact I&rsquo;m not even sure recent Mongos run on the RPi 1?</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/google/leveldb">LevelDB</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Level/levelup">LevelUP</a> are well known and widely used. I think <a href="https://github.com/fritzy/Dulcimer">Dulcimer</a> probably less so. It&rsquo;s a <a href="http://mongoosejs.com/">Mongoose-ish</a> ORM for LevelDB. I was able to tie it into <a href="http://passportjs.org/">PassportJS</a> without much effort to handle users/sessions/etc. I have two setups using it and both have been running for many months on d&rsquo;internet with zero problems. In one case it&rsquo;s a small stats dashboard running on DigitalOcean with a few registered users who check it maybe once a day. The other one is a registration system for people requesting access to some internal work resources. All submissions go into LevelDB.

<h2 id="tingodb-and-tungus:b9c1e366c3521fb5cdf8cf868ebc63d4">TingoDB and Tungus</h2>

<p>Of the NoSQL file-based databases, this seems to have the lowest profile and I think it deserves a <em>lot</em> of attention. <a href="https://github.com/sergeyksv/tingodb">TingoDB</a> emulates most of the common MongoDB APIs and <a href="https://github.com/sergeyksv/tungus">Tungus</a> emulates most of the Mongoose ones. I was able to take a <a href="https://github.com/sahat/tvshow-tracker">random Node.js project</a> off GitHub which is based on MongoDB/Mongoose/Mongoskin and get it running using TingoDB/Tungus on an RPi with only a tiny bit of fiddling with the <a href="https://github.com/rschmukler/agenda/">Agenda</a> module. This is huge for those wanting to do NoSQL on Raspberry Pi. I&rsquo;ll be playing a lot more with this setup in the coming weeks. You really should too.</p>

<h2 id="sqlite-knex-and-bookshelf:b9c1e366c3521fb5cdf8cf868ebc63d4">SQLite, Knex and Bookshelf</h2>

<p>Whilst the whole hipster dev world thinks NoSQL is the answer to everything, good old relational databases just keep on trucking. I&rsquo;ve used <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> many times over the years for simple projects and it has always worked well. I hadn&rsquo;t realised until recently that the main SQL ORMs on Node.js support it out of the box. So again, if you have a project that needs a relational DB and doesn&rsquo;t need huge scale, you should be looking at SQLite. I&rsquo;m currently wrapping up a simple in-house project using SQLite with <a href="http://knexjs.org/">Knex</a> and <a href="http://bookshelfjs.org/">Bookshelf</a> on a Raspberry Pi. The DB hold simple relationships between devices and their status.</p>

<p>The latter two setups above also have the big advantage that you can use them in development or in the early production stages and then you can drop in MongoDB or MySQL at a later stage if needed, without any re-coding.</p>

                        <p><a href="http://zeromq.org/">ZeroMQ</a> is a lightweight messaging library and looks ideal for lower powered devices like the RPi. Building and running is pretty easy. These are really just notes for myself for future reference.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t actually need a messaging system yet but I wanted to play around with one. Running a simple Request / Reply setup with Node.js on both Windows 10 and RPi was interesting. One advantage a message queue gives you over REST is that the receiver can be out of action and still get all transmitted messages when it recovers. You also have things like Pub/Sub etc. I&rsquo;ve been running the code <a href="http://blog.rastating.com/using-zeromq-with-node-js/">from here</a> 100% reliably for two days now on both setups. At some point I&rsquo;ll check max throughput on a Pi.</p>

<p>Installation on Raspberry Pi:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">cd
sudo apt-get install libtool pkg-config build-essential autoconf automake
mkdir build
cd build/
wget https://download.libsodium.org/libsodium/releases/libsodium-1.0.3.tar.gz

cd ..
wget http://download.zeromq.org/zeromq-4.1.3.tar.gz
tar -zxvf zeromq-4.1.3.tar.gz
cd zeromq-4.1.3/
./configure

                        <p>We had friends over from the US last weekend and their kids loved my <a href="http://printrbot.com/project/simple-makers/">Printrbot 3D printer</a>. They had learned <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/">Tinkercad</a> in school so that&rsquo;s what they used to create things so they could print them out. They are now hounding their parents for a printer. Oops :-) But I noticed a &ldquo;Download to Minecraft&rdquo; option in Tinkercad and finally just had a chance to try it out. Wow!</p>

<p><img src="http://conoroneill.net.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/tinker02b.jpg" alt="In Tinkercad" /></p>

<p><a href="http://blog.tinkercad.com/2013/08/15/tinkercraft/">It&rsquo;s incredibly easy</a>. Take any model from Tinkercad and pick the Minecraft option. You may have to tweak the sizing when you are doing it seriously. Then install the <a href="http://www.mcedit.net/downloads.html">MCEdit Minecraft editor</a> and import the file into one of your worlds. Then load up Minecraft and thar she blows.</p>

<p><img src="http://conoroneill.net.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/tinker01b.jpg" alt="In Minecraft" /></p>

<p>I totally love the intersection of 3D design, 3D printing and Minecraft - the real and the virtual coming together. The younger kids are gonna be psyched when I show em!</p>
