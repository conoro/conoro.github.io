<p>Nice quick intro by iJustine into this entire <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/">Quantified Self</a> area. The section about using all of the data for predictive prevention of problems really caught my attention.</p>
<p>httpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjKA0-PSA9k</p>
<p>I&#39;ve obviously been into the whole SoLoMo thing since first getting my hands on an N95-8GB in 2007 and I&#39;ve been generating lots and lots of location data since then. But location is really only step zero. It gets far more interesting the more things you measure, which is why I also tried my first fitness tracking app on the N95 back then too.</p>
<p>Now I spend my day with a Fitbit One connected to my t-shirt; manually entering my weight, body/visceral fat, BMI, muscle from Omron Karadascan to Google Docs; having every run/walk tracked by RunKeeper or Endomondo; and, from this week, having an array of sensors on my desk measuring temperature, humidity and light. The latter set will soon be stored live to the web. My SGS4 has a barometric pressure sensor too and will be the &quot;base-station&quot; for all my experiments in this area.</p>
<p>One bit I&#39;m missing is heart monitoring. I have an ancient chest-strap monitor from Lidl but it has no computer interface and is very uncomfortable. iJustine showed off an Adidas smart-bra which seems to have the functionality I need. Perfect for my moobs. Now I just need to find the male equivalent (or buy one and modify it :-) ). Alternatively I could try making one with some conductive cloth and an Arduino or will I end up in DSP filter hell? A <a href="http://pulsesensor.com/">fingertip sensor like this</a> might be fine for some scenarios but you&#39;re hardly going to wear it 24x7. Any other suggestions?</p>
<p>The only way you can improve is by measuring. I think we&#39;re in for a very interesting couple of years and I can&#39;t wait to see what people come up with.</p>
<p>UPDATE 1: According to comments on the <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11574">Sparkfun site</a>, that Pulse Sensor can be used on many parts of the body, including the chest. As I haven&#39;t found any other Open Hardware projects that do heart rate monitoring, I think I&#39;ll take a punt on it for $25.</p>
