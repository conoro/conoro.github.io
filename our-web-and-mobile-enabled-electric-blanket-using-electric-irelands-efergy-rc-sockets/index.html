                        <p>A major ongoing struggle in our household is convincing one of our many children to go upstairs and put on the electric blanket for us. I honestly don&rsquo;t know how we get through the winter.</p>

<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be fantastic if we could use technology instead of children to do this?</p>

<p>Last Thursday I came home from work to discover that <a href="http://www.electricireland.ie/">Electric Ireland</a> had sent us three <a href="http://efergy.com/eu/products/remotecontrolledsocket">Efergy</a> remote control power sockets and a plugin energy monitor. I have no idea why they did so, apart perhaps from our crazy electricity use.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/efergy01.jpg" alt="Efergy" title="Efergy RC Switch" /></p>

<p>My mind immediately leaped to our electric blanket conundrum.</p>

<p>A quick look at the label and I was pleased to see they worked at 433Mhz. What were the chances that the <a href="http://dx.com/p/433mhz-wireless-transmitter-module-superregeneration-for-arduino-green-149254">$1.99 wireless modules</a> I bought from DX in China would work with them? Oh the joy to discover that, not only do the modules work with them, some genius has already built <a href="https://code.google.com/p/rc-switch/">a powerful Arduino library</a> to do so!</p>

<p>It turns out that the Efergy brand uses the same simple protocol as a wide range of others around the world. I guess they are all OEMing something.</p>

<p>A 2 minute setup on my Arduino Uno with a receiver and the relevant sniffer code loaded up and I had the 11 codes (5 on, 5 off, 1 all-off) that my specific remote control used. They are all 24bit, protocol &ldquo;1&rdquo; with 6 decimal digits like 109223. I assume they distribute a range of remotes to avoid neighbours clashing. The RC switches themselves are not locked to a specific code, they have to be set by the remote control at power up.</p>

<p>2 more minutes to setup a transmitter to cycle between the codes and I was toggling the RC switches on and off.</p>

<p>I really was gobsmacked how easy it was. It was a lovely reminder of how incredible the internet really is. We&rsquo;ve become so used to it, we forget that the above would have taken me months (or never!) in pre-internet days instead of 10 minutes total.</p>

<p>Of course that was just step 1. What I really wanted to do was internet-enable these beauties. I&rsquo;ve been meaning to do something along these lines with the <a href="http://digistump.com/products/50">DigiX</a> board since I got it. The DigiX is a really powerful Arduino clone with a 32-bit Atmel ARM CPU, tons upon tons of IO, SD card, audio and, most importantly for this project, Wifi on-board.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/digix01.jpg" alt="frontside" title="DigiX with module" /></p>

<p>Getting Wifi setup the way I wanted on the DigiX took more time than I&rsquo;d have liked yesterday but I finally figured out that the <a href="http://en.usr.cn/low-power-wifi-module.html">Chinese USR-wifi232-g module</a> web UI doesn&rsquo;t like Chrome! Once I switched to Firefox, all went swimmingly. I connected it to a Wifi AP, gave it a fixed IP address and then setup a port forward from the house router to it. Obviously I use <a href="http://dyn.com/">Dynamic DNS with Dyn</a> on the home router so that I don&rsquo;t have to track changing IP addresses manually.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/digix02.jpg" alt="backside" title="DigiX other side" /></p>

<p>The DigiX comes with an example Web Server built-in so I was able to just create a few simple URLs and paste the RCSwitch code into the relevant places. So within another few minutes I was toggling the switches over the internet.</p>

<pre><code>switch1State = 1;
mySwitch.send(109323, 24);

</code></pre>

<p>Another moment when I forced myself to stop and think about how incredibly easy all this stuff has become. And all of it sitting on the shoulders of giants. So far, all I&rsquo;ve done is copy and paste stuff together.</p>

<p>But of course I wasn&rsquo;t happy there. I wanted a mobile app! Luckily, Colum Bennet in <a href="http://www.feedhenry.com">FeedHenry</a> has created a superb new Getting Started guide which will be released soon. It walks you through creating an <a href="http://angularjs.org/">Angular</a> Hybrid mobile app which talks to a FeedHenry Node.js back-end to do a really simple task. Despite only playing a programmer for the purposes of blogging, I was able to easily modify both the client and cloud apps to create what I needed with the Node request module.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/app01.jpg" alt="Angular" title="FeedHenry Angular App" /></p>

<p>Of course I could send the commands directly from the mobile app to the DigiX, but routing it through the cloud means that eventually this can be multi-user, multi-switch, re-configurable and securely locked-down.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/app02.jpg" alt="Success" title="Mobile App Success" /></p>

<p>One really nice feature of the FeedHenry platform is that you can generate hosted Web Apps from your mobile Apps. This means that whilst I now have a lovely Android APK on my Galaxy S4, my wife can use the web app on her iPhone to achieve exactly the same thing using a simple bookmarked CNAME.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/webapp.jpg" alt="Web App" title="FeedHenry Web App" /></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll upload everthing on to a public GitHub repo as soon as I have removed all the hard-coding and added a modicum of &ldquo;security&rdquo; with API keys etc. More posts on this technology combo coming in the next few weeks.</p>

<p>With the Bandon Bed Button, we have now achieved Electric Blanket Nirvana.</p>
