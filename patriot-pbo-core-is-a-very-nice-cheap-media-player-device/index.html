                        <p>#&ldquo;Patriot PBO Core is a very nice cheap Media Player device&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve written at length about our media setup at home. The main box remains a low-end PC with a decent graphics card and HDMI-out. It mainly runs <a href="http://xbmc.org/">XBMC</a>but we switch over to Windows Media Centre for playing/recording satellite/terrestial.</p>

<p>We have had two old XBOXes running XBMC for years and they are awesome. Their only drawback is that they don&rsquo;t have enough welly to play h.264 so no MP4s, MKVs, 720p or 1080p.</p>

<p>Last year I got a tiny media playing box called the HDVP-2. I put a 500GB harddisk inside it and it plays everything. It has HDMI, Composite, LAN, USB and an option for WIFI. It&rsquo;s our travel media box and is perfect for hotels or visiting parents and in-laws. However, it has four problems:
<ol>
    <li>It can&rsquo;t browse networks shares over SMB, it only does UPNP. We have all media centralised and shared out over SMB. I use TVersity for UPNP sharing but I just hate the whole UPNP approach.</li>
    <li>It loses audio-video sync on many AVIs very quickly and doesn&rsquo;t have a manual audio-offset like XBMC</li>
    <li>It doesn&rsquo;t spin down the internal harddisk so you have to unplug it except when playing videos</li>
    <li>They aren&rsquo;t making it any more so there will be no bug-fixes or updates and I haven&rsquo;t been able to find any Open Source software that runs on it.</li>
</ol>
Then two weeks ago, one of the XBOXes died, the one we have setup for the treadmill. I refused to use the HDVP-2 due to the AV sync problem and wondered what the best approach might be. I was tempted by one of those dirt-cheap ROKU boxes and discovered they can play local media using a Private Channel trick, in addition to Netflix, but I figured it&rsquo;d be as fiddly as UPNP on the HDVP-2.</p>

<p>Then Irememberedthe <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Patriot-PCMPBO25-Office-Definition-Player/dp/B002Q4U9PY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1329660253&amp;sr=8-1">Patriot PBO Core</a> that I&rsquo;d discussed with <a href="http://twitter.com/swhelband">@swhelband</a> last year. He had bought one and tweeted very positively about it. A quick check revealed it was still for sale on amazon.co.uk for 60. I made sure it had SMB support and then happily ordered. It&rsquo;s a very similar spec to the HDVP-2 but executed far better, so you get:
<ol>
    <li>Very high quality metal case which can take an internal 2.5&rdquo; hard-disk if you want</li>
    <li>HDMI-out</li>
    <li>Composite-out</li>
    <li>Up to 1080p</li>
    <li>Plays every format you can throw at it</li>
    <li>LAN with playing of both SMB and UPNP sources</li>
    <li>USB</li>
    <li>Remote control</li>
</ol>
<a href="http://www.patriotmemory.com/products/detailp.jsp?prodline=6&amp;catid=69&amp;prodgroupid=159&amp;id=895"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-592" title="PBO_Core_IsoRight" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/PBO_Core_IsoRight-1024x1024.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="584" /></a></p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve have it for over a week now and the experience has been mixed. The core functionality is rock solid and I&rsquo;m sure it works perfectly as a local media player. The main issues we&rsquo;ve had have been around network playing. The default firmware has some features which become really annoying, such as:
<ol>
    <li>Insists on checking size etc of every file in a directory as you scroll through. Unbearably slow when doing this over the network.</li>
    <li>Pops-up network access speed as you scroll through files. As if you care!</li>
    <li>Doesn&rsquo;t have an &ldquo;already watched&rdquo; indicator which is a bit of a pain</li>
    <li>Won&rsquo;t let you add top-level shortcuts to specific directories on specific networked machines so you can jump quickly to your stuff after power-on.</li>
</ol>
Luckily the PBO Core is using a reference design (I assume from Realtek) and there are other boxes out there with the same hardware but improved software. I finally found one that avoids all thenetworkproblems <a href="http://patriot-box-office.wikidot.com/pbo-alternative-custom-firmwares">here</a>. (I used the v3.2 Mod from Shizzl of the MedeBO firmware). Upgrading is doddle and you just pop the file onto a USB stick and select &ldquo;System Update&rdquo; on the PBO.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m now a very happy bunny and have exactly what I need. Sure it&rsquo;s nowhere near as slick as XBMC but for 60 I&rsquo;m not going to complain too much.</p>

<p>Unfortunately it shares one downside with the HDVP-2. It&rsquo;s pretty much end-of-lifed and hasn&rsquo;t had a software update since early in 2011. I read recently that Patriot is releasing a much higher-spec Android-based device soon. But if the PBO Core meets your needsthen the lack of updates is not a problem.</p>

<p>Speaking of Android devices, Richard Hearne spotted <a href="http://www.iboum.com/pr/him900a.php">this awesome looking piece of kit</a>. It is more than double the price of the PBO but the feature list is damned impressive.</p>

<p>I also finally gave in and replaced the 10 year old Philips portable 14&rdquo; TV as the display and got a really nice <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/LG-IPS225V-Advanced-Performance-Widescreen/dp/B0060LCBRI/ref=sr_1_1?s=computers&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1329660920&amp;sr=1-1">LG 22&rdquo; IPS, LED 1080p</a> display from Amazon for 110 last week too. The picture quality with this combo is amazing.</p>

<p>Of course if you have an Android phone like a HTC Sensation, you could just use the MHL HDMI-out to achive most of the above. I bet one of the Bluetooth remotes or headset controls would do the trick for selecting the movies etc. I must try mine in a network streaming configuration.</p>

<p>Oh I&rsquo;ll also blog shortly about using a US VPN and PlayOn to deliver Netflix over UPNP to the PBO Core. To be honest it was so much hassle you should just buy a Roku.</p>
