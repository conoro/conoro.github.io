      <description>&lt;p&gt;#&amp;ldquo;Notch makes getting fit a little less po-faced&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting fit and losing weight is a very serious subject. But it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be. All the talk of burn and crunch and walls and plank and core and bootcamps and weigh-ins would put anyone off. No wonder so many people are obese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading Scott Jurek&amp;rsquo;s book &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Eat-Run-Ultramarathon-Greatness-ebook/dp/B005OCHOZS&#34;&gt;Eat &amp;amp; Run&lt;/a&gt; for the past while and it&amp;rsquo;s incredibly inspirational. Not in a happy-clappy sense but in the pure joy of running that leaps off the page. This guy runs 150 mile ultras all the time, including through Death Valley and is a vegan. When I&amp;rsquo;m running 12 miles slowly around Bandon and staring to fade, I just think about some of the stuff in his book and I recover quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s why I found &lt;a href=&#34;http://notch.me&#34;&gt;Notch.me&lt;/a&gt; so brilliant this week. It takes your Fitbit or &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.runkeeper.com&#34;&gt;RunKeeper&lt;/a&gt; info and turns it into a very funny infographic. I think RunKeeper should integrate it into the mobile app. It&amp;rsquo;s a damn sight more motivational than their robot voice at the end of the run saying &amp;ldquo;You ran 14 miles in 3 hours and 4 seconds. Your average pace was blah blah blah&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to put joy back into exercise and fitness. I hope Notch.me is just a start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click through for the full infographic.&lt;/p&gt;
