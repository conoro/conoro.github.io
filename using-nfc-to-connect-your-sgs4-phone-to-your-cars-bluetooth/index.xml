      <description>&lt;p&gt;#&amp;ldquo;Using NFC to connect your #SGS4 phone to your car&amp;rsquo;s Bluetooth&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to play with NFC for ages so when I got an SGS4 recently, my chance finally came. I ordered a pack of 10 stickers from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.shop4nfc.com/product-details/NTAG203-type-2-nfc-tags-shop4nfc&#34;&gt;Shop4NFC.com&lt;/a&gt; in China for $8.99 and they arrived about a week later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To try them out, I installed the &lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jwsoft.nfcactionlauncher&amp;amp;hl=en&#34;&gt;NFC Task Launcher&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm&amp;amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsIm5ldC5kaW5nbGlzY2guYW5kcm9pZC50YXNrZXJtIl0.&#34;&gt;Tasker&lt;/a&gt; Apps. The former enables you to do things like change Wifi settings, volume, display, sync email or even Tweet when it detects a configured NFC sticker. One of the most common use cases is for people to have a sticker at work which puts the phone on mute when you lay the phone on top of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tasker is a general automation app that is not reliant on NFC and can do a ton of different complex things based on context and actions. The reason I installed it is that it can do more complex stuff with Bluetooth than NFC Task Launcher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was really disappointed to discover that Bluetooth on the SGS4 is as buggy and glitchy as every other Android phone I&amp;rsquo;ve owned. Google&amp;rsquo;s announcement at I/O yesterday that they are going to improve things this year doesn&amp;rsquo;t convince me. They&amp;rsquo;ve had 4 years to get it right. The fact that they broke access to Wiimotes etc in 4.2 tells you just how bad they are at Bluetooth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The place where this causes me the most grief is in the car. All I want is for the bloody phone to auto-connect over A2DP to my Lidl Car stereo when the car is on so I can play my podcasts and listen to music. In theory the SGS4 can do this but simply fails to, 9 times out of 10. HTC&amp;rsquo;s Android was similarly bad. AOSP/Cyanogen in some versions worked perfectly but it was a crapshoot whether any version would work or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/nfc.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1041&#34; alt=&#34;nfc&#34; src=&#34;https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/nfc.jpg&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;707&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I thought NFC might solve this. Rather than letting Android itself auto-connect, use Tasker to force a connection. And whaddya know, it seems to work. I tap the phone off the sticker after I turn on the ignition and it connects over Bluetooth to the car stereo. It&amp;rsquo;s only failed once in 10 and I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure that&amp;rsquo;s because I didn&amp;rsquo;t hold the phone to the sticker long enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, that&amp;rsquo;s really the only downside of NFC that I&amp;rsquo;ve seen so far. A swipe or momentary tap is not good enough, it requires a very distinct touch and hold for a moment before the tag powers up and sends its ID info to the phone. You can tell by the audio cue on the SGS4 whether it worked or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I need to find uses for the other 9 stickers. Suggestions?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
