This:&quot;</h1><p>After my <a href="https://www.blocbuy.com/87/product">Fitbit One</a> took a swim in a full washing machine cycle, it died. Many attempts with rice and pampers and warm air over a few days failed to bring it back. The utterly fantastic customer support people in Fitbit then offered me a free replacement! The only tiny downside is that they don&#39;t deliver to Ireland so I needed to use a <a href="http://www.parcelmotel.com/">Parcel Motel</a> address. It just arrived yesterday so I thought I may as well have a look inside the dead one.</p>
<p>It&#39;s bloody well glued together so it took a while. I could instantly see that there was no hope that it would have recovered. Horrible green corrosion on many places on the motherboard.</p>
<p><a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2013-06-07-17.08.52.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1100" alt="2013-06-07 17.08.52" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2013-06-07-17.08.52-1024x576.jpg" width="584" height="328"></a></p>
<p>The main CPU/MCU is a ST Microelectonics ARM M3 (<a href="http://www.st.com/web/catalog/mmc/FM141/SC1544/SS1374/LN1041/PF251638">STM32L151QCH6</a>) running at 32 MHz with 256KB flash. Same one as the Nike Fuelband, interestingly enough. I figure its built-in USB interface is a real selling point.</p>
<p>The LiPo battery is the smallest I&#39;ve ever seen and I hope I can salvage it. Also the tiny buzzer motor might be usable somewhere.</p>

<p>The Nordic Semiconductor <a href="http://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/Products/Bluetooth-R-low-energy/nRF8001">nRF8001 IC</a> is very interesting. It&#39;s a full-blown single-chip Bluetooth 4.0 BLE (Low Energy) solution. I&#39;ve been looking around for hobbyist BLE chips/dev-boards recently but they are too expensive. I&#39;d love to see BLE used in home automation setups.</p>
<p>Our experience with tracking down a lost Fitbit inside the house using BLE sync from my phone to my wife&#39;s Fitbit has made me a big fan of the technology! It would never ever have been found without being able to send alarms and triangulating in on where the lost device was. I eventually found it behind the lining inside a travel case in the airing cupboard after it had fallen from my wife&#39;s armband in the middle of the night as she grabbed new bedclothes for one of the children. The last time something went missing in the airing cupboard, we lost a Nintendo DS for a year.</p>
<p>I&#39;d love to see the next Fitbit have all the functionality of the One but also be 100% waterproof. Maybe simple capacitive touch instead of a button? That and the fact that the sleep timer has zero intelligence around auto-turn-off are the only criticisms I can make of an otherwise brilliant device. The recent update allows it to sync directly with my SGS4 so travelling will no longer be a &quot;dark period&quot; for up-to-date tracking.</p>
<p>Do yourself a favour, buy one and shock yourself when you realise just how inactive you really are.</p>
