      <description>&lt;p&gt;#&amp;ldquo;What does this inside of a dead Fitbit One look like? This:&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After my &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.blocbuy.com/87/product&#34;&gt;Fitbit One&lt;/a&gt; took a swim in a full washing machine cycle, it died. Many attempts with rice and pampers and warm air over a few days failed to bring it back. The utterly fantastic customer support people in Fitbit then offered me a free replacement! The only tiny downside is that they don&amp;rsquo;t deliver to Ireland so I needed to use a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.parcelmotel.com/&#34;&gt;Parcel Motel&lt;/a&gt; address. It just arrived yesterday so I thought I may as well have a look inside the dead one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s bloody well glued together so it took a while. I could instantly see that there was no hope that it would have recovered. Horrible green corrosion on many places on the motherboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2013-06-07-17.08.52.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-large wp-image-1100&#34; alt=&#34;2013-06-07 17.08.52&#34; src=&#34;https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2013-06-07-17.08.52-1024x576.jpg&#34; width=&#34;584&#34; height=&#34;328&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main CPU/MCU is a ST Microelectonics ARM M3 (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.st.com/web/catalog/mmc/FM141/SC1544/SS1374/LN1041/PF251638&#34;&gt;STM32L151QCH6&lt;/a&gt;) running at 32 MHz with 256KB flash. Same one as the Nike Fuelband, interestingly enough. I figure its built-in USB interface is a real selling point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The LiPo battery is the smallest I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen and I hope I can salvage it. Also the tiny buzzer motor might be usable somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-large wp-image-1099&#34; alt=&#34;2013-06-07 17.08.41&#34; src=&#34;https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2013-06-07-17.08.41-1024x576.jpg&#34; width=&#34;584&#34; height=&#34;328&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nordic Semiconductor &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/Products/Bluetooth-R-low-energy/nRF8001&#34;&gt;nRF8001 IC&lt;/a&gt; is very interesting. It&amp;rsquo;s a full-blown single-chip Bluetooth 4.0 BLE (Low Energy) solution. I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking around for hobbyist BLE chips/dev-boards recently but they are too expensive. I&amp;rsquo;d love to see BLE used in home automation setups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our experience with tracking down a lost Fitbit inside the house using BLE sync from my phone to my wife&amp;rsquo;s Fitbit has made me a big fan of the technology! It would never ever have been found without being able to send alarms and triangulating in on where the lost device was. I eventually found it behind the lining inside a travel case in the airing cupboard after it had fallen from my wife&amp;rsquo;s armband in the middle of the night as she grabbed new bedclothes for one of the children. The last time something went missing in the airing cupboard, we lost a Nintendo DS for a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d love to see the next Fitbit have all the functionality of the One but also be 100% waterproof. Maybe simple capacitive touch instead of a button? That and the fact that the sleep timer has zero intelligence around auto-turn-off are the only criticisms I can make of an otherwise brilliant device. The recent update allows it to sync directly with my SGS4 so travelling will no longer be a &amp;ldquo;dark period&amp;rdquo; for up-to-date tracking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do yourself a favour, buy one and shock yourself when you realise just how inactive you really are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
