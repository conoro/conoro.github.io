      <description>&lt;p&gt;#&amp;ldquo;Super-Smart Use of Android Portable Hotspot from 11 y/o Son&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I upgraded to the HTC Desire, I gave my old G1 to my eldest son. We try to keep it up-to-date and it is currently running the Cyanogen version of Android 2.2 Froyo. One problem he ran into is that he is on a PAYG O2 SIM and relies on the indulgence of his Grandparents and Aunties/Uncles for call credit. He didn&amp;#39;t fully realise that when he is out of the house, he is paying for mobile data as some extortionate rate. So all his credit quickly disappeared. To avoid a re-occurrence, we have disabled mobile data so he can only use Wi-Fi.&lt;p /&gt; Last night he was listening to me convincing his Grandad to replace his old Nokia phone with the HTC Desire. This had a positive outcome despite two of the three iPhone owners in the holiday home having aneurysms as a result. One of the features I showed my Dad was the portable hot-spot in Froyo. It removes the need for a MiFi device. I have a 1GB data add-on with Vodafone which is more than sufficient for my hand-set needs and the odd bit of sharing to the laptop.&lt;p /&gt; Today the youngfella came up with a genius idea. He asked if it was possible for me to turn on the hot-spot on my phone and for him to then use the data-connection by connecting via Wi-Fi to me. Initially the smartness of the idea escaped me. But he pointed out that if we are out-and-about somewhere and there is no Wi-Fi, he&amp;#39;d be able to use my data connection to play his Youtube videos etc etc. Smart little sod. The same solution applies to any Wi-Fi tablet, laptop, iPod Touch or anyone on a PAYG SIM. It&amp;#39;s almost like a mobile version of FON for people you know.&lt;p /&gt; I&amp;#39;m sure there is some idiotic T&amp;amp;C in the Vodafone site saying I&amp;#39;m not allowed to do this. Mobile carriers still seem to think the contents of packets actually matter (&amp;quot;Get Facebook for Free on your phone with Three Ireland&amp;quot;). In fact I&amp;#39;ve heard you have to pay $30 extra a month to enable tethering on Android phones with some carriers in the US!&lt;p /&gt; I&amp;#39;m really looking forward to the glut of cheap-as-chips Android handsets that will start coming out of China. Even with resistive screens and minimal features, they will be the next must-have phones for pre-teens and teens in 2011.&lt;p /&gt; In any case, well done the youngfella for figuring out a solution to his problem.&lt;p /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
