      <description>&lt;p&gt;#&amp;ldquo;Click &amp;amp; Buy make themselves look like scammers&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Catherine found a charge on our Mastercard recently that we could not get to the bottom of. We then discovered it recurred all the way back to September. &lt;p /&gt;It was from &amp;quot;Click and Buy&amp;quot;. We contacted Mastercard but all they could say was &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s for professional services&amp;quot;. I went on to Click and Buy to discover a lot of online gambling logos. So of course we suspected the card had been hijacked.&lt;p /&gt; I contacted Click and Buy who took weeks to reply and just shrugged their shoulders and say they had no idea. In the meantime, Catherine finally figured out that the charge was for Moshi Monsters.&lt;p /&gt;If Click and Buy want to avoid looking like Arthur Daly they need to add the merchant details to every Mastercard transaction that they make.&lt;p /&gt; And Moshi Monsters has lost a customer. That&amp;#39;s stupid money for a kids online game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
