<p> The horror that is broadband in West Cork means that heavy-duty internet-centric businesses willprobablyavoid being based here. However we did run into a little-known business advantage last week.<p /><div>We are prepping to exhibit LouderVoice at a major show in the UK soon (details to be announced shortly) and we contacted Enterprise Ireland to see what supports/grants they offer to companies doing this. It turns out that they usually pay 50% of any expenses incurred which is fantastic. It is also one of the few areas in EI that has not seen a major reduction due to its importance to export-oriented companies.<p /><div>However the EU did create one small glitch which is that companies in receipt of BES or SCS investment don&#39;t get the full 50% and we are one of those companies. If we were in Cork City (or Dublin, Kildare, Wicklow and Meath), the grant would be reduced to 25%. But because West Cork is seen as a &quot;disadvantaged&quot; area along with the rest of rural Ireland, we get a 40% grant. Score 1 for Bandon! Next they&#39;ll give us FTTH.</div> <p /><p /></div></p>
