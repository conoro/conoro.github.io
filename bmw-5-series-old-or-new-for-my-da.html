Old or new for my Da?</h1><h2 class="sm date">1266673949000</h2><h1>&quot;BMW 5-Series. Old or new for my Da?&quot;</h1>
 <p>My Da&#39;s 12 year old BMW will fail its NCT unless he has 5 grand of work done on it so he has finally decided to get a new one. The new 520d and 525d are catching his eye. The advantage of the 525d is that it is available in March. The big disadvantage is a massive price uplift over the 520d. But he can&#39;t really wait until July for the 520d to be released.</p>
<p>The garage has some current model 520d&#39;s in stock and he is wondering should he just get one of them instead. I&#39;ve been doing some research and I think he should but then I&#39;ve never owned a Beemer so would appreciate advice from those in the know. My feelings are:</p>
<ol>
<li>He can get current 520d for a good deal if he negotiates hard (and waits for new shape to be launched)</li>
<li>Nothing reported about the new 5 Series would matter to him (new shape, 8 speed auto, better iDrive, better suspension)</li>
<li>After 5 years, the three models will all be very similar in re-sale price. In particular, the 520d-&gt;525d delta will have disappeared</li>
</ol>
<p>My only concern is that moving from 5L petrol to 2L diesel may be a leap too far for him. Some decent test drives on the new Waterford bypass should hopefully answer that.</p>
<p>How is the 520d for refinement,&nbsp;reliability, service cost etc? His old 7-Series is a lovely car but as reliable as a Trabant and spares cost a fortune.</p>
<p>Or should he consider Merc/Audi? He&#39;s been a BMW guy since the 80s when his job upgraded him from the vinyl-roofed Granada :-)&nbsp;</p>
